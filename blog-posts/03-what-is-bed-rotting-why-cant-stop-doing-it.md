# What Is 'Bed-Rotting' and Why You Can't Stop Doing It

*It's 3 PM. You've been in bed since yesterday. Your phone is at 10%. You're not even watching anything good anymore.*

## The Bed-Rotting Phenomenon

You know the drill. You wake up feeling heavy, like your body is made of lead. The idea of getting up and facing the day feels impossible. So you don't. You stay in bed, scrolling through your phone, watching random videos, or just staring at the ceiling.

Hours pass. Maybe you eat something. Maybe you don't. The day slips away, and you're still there, in bed, feeling worse than when you started.

This is what I call "bed-rotting"—and if you're reading this, you probably know exactly what I'm talking about.

## Why It's Not Laziness

Here's the thing about bed-rotting: It's not laziness. It's not a character flaw. It's not you being dramatic or attention-seeking. It's a coping mechanism, albeit a destructive one.

When you're in a depressive state, your brain is trying to protect you from overwhelming emotions and situations. Staying in bed feels safe. It's a way to avoid the world that feels too big, too scary, too demanding.

But here's the problem: **Bed-rotting doesn't actually help. It just delays the inevitable.**

## The Psychology of Avoidance

I learned this the hard way during college. I would sit in front of my computer screen after playing games late into the night, the monitor illuminating our room at 3 AM. I'd glance back to see my roommate asleep behind me, and I'd realize I had been trying to escape what I perceived as an emotional doldrum through one of my favorite pastimes.

But here's what I didn't realize at the time: **My pastime had transitioned into a vice.**

I closed my computer and started getting ready for bed. Aside from the excitement I would feel while playing, I couldn't perceive any real improvement to my emotions after ending my gaming session. As if things couldn't get worse, staying up late would make it hard to focus in my classes tomorrow.

"Maybe I should just skip classes and try to reset my emotions," I thought to myself. "I won't get anything done feeling like this."

## The Vice Trap

Be it video games, browsing social media late into the night, or any other form of bed-rotting, life is full of vices that seek to distract us. They cause us to make poor use of our agency and present themselves as a form of escape.

It's in our nature to practice avoidance when it comes to mortal dangers, but this practice cannot help you escape emotional or mental trials and challenges. **They don't disappear over time; you only delay facing them.**

Vices dampen and delay painful emotions, but they do nothing to help us dismantle or overcome their source. While your vice may grant you a temporary reprieve, a downward spiral of emotions is beginning to wreak havoc on your mind the longer you continue to delay confronting the source of your pain.

It may not happen right away, but **emotions fester as you continue to avoid or dampen them.**

## The Doppelgänger Connection

Here's where things get interesting. Your bed-rotting behavior isn't really you—it's your Evil Doppelgänger at work.

Your Evil Doppelgänger wants you isolated. It wants you to waste time. It wants you to avoid the people and activities that might actually help you feel better. It wants you to believe that staying in bed is the only option.

**But here's the truth: They're not the main character. You are.**

## Breaking the Cycle

So how do you break out of the bed-rotting cycle? It starts with understanding that the first step is always the hardest, but it's also the most important.

### The Snowball Effect

One of the most powerful strategies I learned was the concept of the "snowball effect." When you're at your lowest, you don't need to tackle everything at once. You just need to do one small thing that can create momentum.

**Start with making your bed.**

I know it sounds trivial, but there's something powerful about completing one simple task. It proves to yourself that you can still take action, even when you don't feel like it. It creates a small sense of accomplishment that can build into something bigger.

### The "Who Is in Charge?" Question

Every morning, no matter how I felt, I would ask myself: "Who is in charge of my day?"

The answer, even when I didn't believe it, was always: "I AM!"

This simple practice reminded me that I still had agency, even in my darkest moments. I was still the main character in my story, even when my Evil Doppelgänger was trying to convince me otherwise.

### When Things Go Wrong

When something in your day goes awry, pause for a moment. Remember who is in charge of your day. Recall your intentions for the future and believe in them. Close your eyes, take a deep breath, exhale slowly, and smile.

This new problem you are facing may be uncomfortable or present strange unknowns, but those difficulties will be for your gain as you work through them. **The stronger the wind, the stronger the tree. Rise up and overcome your challenges. You are in control and you are amazing.**

## Designing Your First Trap Card

A Trap Card is a pre-planned strategy that activates when you're in a depressive state. The key is to design it when you're feeling good, not when you're already struggling.

**Here's how to create your first Trap Card:**

1. **Identify the first painful step** (usually taking responsibility for something)
2. **Plan an emotional release activity** (something that helps you process your feelings)
3. **Design a recovery action** (something that moves you forward)

**Example Trap Card:**
- **Step 1:** Call someone you trust and admit you're struggling
- **Step 2:** Go for a walk or do some light exercise
- **Step 3:** Do one productive task (like making your bed or cleaning your room)

**The key insight:** If your depression fights planning it, it'll work especially well. Your Evil Doppelgänger knows what you're trying to do and will try to convince you not to set the trap. This resistance is actually a green flag that your Trap Card will be effective.

## The Truth About Vices

Here's what I want you to understand about vices and bed-rotting: They're not inherently bad. The problem isn't the activity itself—it's how you're using it.

**Healthy entertainment:** You play video games or watch shows because you enjoy them, and they add value to your life.

**Vice behavior:** You play video games or watch shows to escape from your emotions, and they make you feel worse afterward.

The difference is in your intention and the outcome. If an activity is helping you avoid your feelings rather than process them, it's become a vice.

## Building a Better Environment

Your environment has a huge impact on your tendency to bed-rot. Here are the four key factors that influence your mental health:

1. **Who you live with** (most impactful)
2. **Your community and friend groups**
3. **Your responsibilities and obligations**
4. **The entertainment and vices available to you**

**Questions to ask yourself:**
- Does your living situation support your mental health?
- Are you surrounded by people who bring out your best self?
- Do your daily responsibilities feel manageable?
- Are you easily able to access healthy activities?

## The Journey Forward

Breaking the bed-rotting cycle isn't easy, but it's possible. It starts with recognizing that you're not lazy or weak—you're dealing with a real mental health challenge that requires real strategies.

**Remember:**
- You are not your lowest moments
- You are in charge of your day
- Small actions can create big changes
- You don't have to face this alone

The goal isn't to never feel like staying in bed again. The goal is to recognize when your Evil Doppelgänger is trying to isolate you and choose a different path instead.

**You are the main character in your story. You get to decide how it goes.**
