# Depression Trap Cards: What They Are and How to Build Yours

*It's 9 PM on a Sunday. I'm failing college. And I'm about to make the phone call I've been dreading all week.*

## The Phone Call That Changed Everything

I wasn't performing well in my classes, and I was feeling defeated as my peers excelled and I floundered. This wasn't a one-time occurrence, but I distinctly remember one especially emotional Sunday night around 9:00 PM. I was running out of distractions, and I finally decided to face my problem and call my parents.

They were funding a large portion of my college, and I was always scared to call them in these moments.

Walking outside after getting on the phone with my mom, I explained where I was at emotionally and how I was struggling to find traction in my classes. I spent 2 hours talking with my parents and walking around the block, discussing my next steps along with the coming consequences due to my slothfulness. I might need to withdraw from a class to get caught up in my others.

As the call concluded, I remember feeling grateful for her patience.

When I got back to my home, I laid down in the grass outside my apartment and stared up at the stars through watery eyes and pondered my emotions. My mom had set me straight and allowed my thoughts and feelings to confront the reality of my actions, and I now had a plan to fix my problems. However, the emotions were still fresh.

I went inside and proceeded to watch a portion of Disney's Treasure Planet that holds a special place in my heart from my childhood. As I watched what is arguably one of the best animated scenes of all time, accompanied by John Rzeznik's rendition of "I'm Still Here," I let the wave of emotions pour over me as I sang along. Tears now coming easier than they had earlier, I laid down on my sofa and I reminded myself that I belonged here in this life, with my family and friends.

This experience happened multiple times during college. I eventually began to call these decisions a Trap Card.

## What Is a Trap Card?

A Trap Card is a pre-planned strategy designed to pull you out of depressive states. I borrowed the concept from the Yu-Gi-Oh! card game, where trap cards activate when triggered by specific conditions.

**The key insight:** In that emotional space, my doppelgänger never wants to take the first step. In this story, the first step was reaching out to my mother. You'll notice another story of me on the phone with my mom shows up again, because it was the most effective Trap Card I had in college.

**The first step of every Trap Card you devise will always be the most painful one, and they almost always involve taking responsibility for things that are going on.**

When you are finally starting to come out of a depressive state, big or small, you feel great and you often wonder, "Why didn't I do that sooner?!" Even though moments ago, that was the last thing you would have ever wanted to do.

## The Anatomy of an Effective Trap Card

Let me break down my most frequently played Trap Card to show you how they work:

### Step 1: The Painful First Step
**A phone call with my mom to admit my mistakes and take responsibility for my actions.**

This is always the hardest part. Your Evil Doppelgänger will fight you on this. It will tell you that you're bothering people, that they don't want to hear from you, that you should figure it out on your own. But this is exactly why it works.

### Step 2: The Emotional Release
**Reconnected with my emotions by reflecting on a powerful emotional experience, in this case a film.**

After taking responsibility, you need a way to process all those pent-up emotions. This could be watching a movie, listening to music, going for a walk, or any activity that helps you feel and process your emotions.

### Step 3: The Recovery Action
**All those negative emotions from my slothfulness and positive emotions about my new plan are finally brought to the surface of my mind and heart all in a single moment, which allowed me to have an emotional release.**

The final step is taking some kind of action that moves you forward. This could be making a plan, doing something productive, or simply reminding yourself of your worth and belonging.

## Why Trap Cards Work

Trap Cards work because they're designed to activate when you're at your lowest, when your Evil Doppelgänger is running the show. Here's why they're so effective:

### 1. They're Pre-Planned
You design them when you're feeling good, not when you're already struggling. This means you're thinking clearly and can create strategies that will actually work.

### 2. They Address the Root Problem
The first step always involves taking responsibility, which is exactly what your doppelgänger doesn't want you to do. This is why it works.

### 3. They Provide Emotional Release
Depression often involves suppressed emotions. Trap Cards give you a safe way to process and release those emotions.

### 4. They Create Forward Momentum
By ending with a recovery action, Trap Cards help you move from a place of helplessness to a place of agency and control.

## Examples of Powerful Trap Cards

Here are some Trap Cards I would frequently use, along with others you might consider:

### The Phone Call Trap Card
- **Step 1:** Call a loved one and admit you're struggling
- **Step 2:** Walk outside and get some fresh air
- **Step 3:** Make a plan to address what's causing the depression

### The Roommate Trap Card
- **Step 1:** Explain your difficulties to someone you live with
- **Step 2:** Ask them to check in on you regularly
- **Step 3:** Create an accountability system

### The Service Trap Card
- **Step 1:** Do something productive and eccentric (like cleaning your room)
- **Step 2:** Focus on how it helps someone else
- **Step 3:** Build momentum with another small task

### The Pet Trap Card
- **Step 1:** Take care of your pet (feed, walk, play)
- **Step 2:** Focus on their needs and unconditional love
- **Step 3:** Use the momentum to take care of yourself

### The Creative Trap Card
- **Step 1:** Engage in a creative activity (draw, write, play music)
- **Step 2:** Express your emotions through the medium
- **Step 3:** Share your creation with someone you trust

## How to Build Your First Trap Card

Now it's time to create your own Trap Card. Here's the step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Identify the First Painful Step
This is usually taking responsibility for something. It might be:
- Admitting you're struggling to someone
- Asking for help
- Facing a problem you've been avoiding
- Making a difficult decision

**The key:** If your doppelgänger fights planning it, it'll work especially well.

### Step 2: Plan Your Emotional Release
This is something that helps you process your emotions. It might be:
- Watching a movie or TV show
- Listening to music
- Going for a walk
- Writing in a journal
- Calling a friend

### Step 3: Design Your Recovery Action
This is something that moves you forward. It might be:
- Making a plan
- Doing something productive
- Reaching out to someone
- Engaging in a hobby
- Practicing self-care

### Step 4: Test and Refine
Try your Trap Card and see how it works. You might need to adjust the steps or try different activities. The goal is to find what works for you.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Making Trap Cards Too Easy
If your Trap Card doesn't feel difficult or uncomfortable, it probably won't work. The first step should always be something you don't want to do.

### Not Planning Them Before Depression Hits
Trap Cards need to be designed when you're feeling good, not when you're already struggling. Your thinking is clearer, and you can create more effective strategies.

### Trying to Rationalize Out of Them
When you're in a depressive state, your doppelgänger will try to convince you not to use your Trap Card. This is actually a sign that it will work. Don't let the resistance stop you.

### Making Them Too Complicated
Keep your Trap Cards simple. Three steps are usually enough. You want something you can remember and execute even when you're not thinking clearly.

## Advanced Strategy: Multiple Trap Cards

As you get better at using Trap Cards, you can create different ones for different situations:

- **The Isolation Trap Card:** For when you're avoiding people
- **The Procrastination Trap Card:** For when you're avoiding responsibilities
- **The Overwhelm Trap Card:** For when everything feels too much
- **The Shame Trap Card:** For when you're feeling worthless

## The Science Behind Trap Cards

Trap Cards work because they address the three key components of depression recovery:

### 1. Agency
By taking responsibility (the first step), you reclaim your sense of agency and control.

### 2. Emotional Processing
By engaging in emotional release activities, you process suppressed emotions that are contributing to your depression.

### 3. Forward Momentum
By ending with a recovery action, you create positive momentum that can carry you out of the depressive state.

## When to Use Trap Cards

Trap Cards are most effective when:
- You recognize you're entering a depressive state
- You feel stuck or helpless
- You're avoiding important responsibilities
- You're isolating yourself from others
- You're engaging in destructive behaviors

## The Journey Forward

Building effective Trap Cards takes practice. You might not get it right the first time, and that's okay. The important thing is to keep trying and refining your approach.

**Remember:**
- The first step is always the hardest
- If you don't want to plan it, it'll work especially well
- You are in charge of your day
- You are in charge of your recovery

The goal isn't to eliminate depression entirely. The goal is to build the tools and strategies that help you recover faster and more effectively when it does strike.

**You've got this. And you're not alone in this journey.**
