# The False Belief Behind Your Depression (And How to Find It)

*I thought I hated college. My father asked one question that changed everything.*

---

## The Question That Revealed Everything

During my time in college, I consistently felt like I didn't deserve to be there, that someone else deserved the experience more than me. I felt lost and confused, and I thought the problem was college itself.

Speaking to my father about this feeling over the phone, he inquired whether or not I felt like I was doing my best in college, to which I replied "No." He followed with another question: "Would someone else do better than you?" Admittedly, I felt that they would. "Yes," I responded.

Finally, he said, "What you are feeling is a lack of confidence and self-worth, it has nothing to do with college and everything to do with how you perceive yourself and your efforts."

The words hurt because they were true. I had been so distracted by college that I hadn't stopped to ponder whether my feelings were isolated to this event or situation, or if they were widespread.

This experience taught me that **the source of your pain is often obscured by a surface-level circumstance.**

## Surface Pain vs. Source Pain

Here's what I want you to understand: **What you think is causing your depression might not be the real problem at all.**

Your emotions are complex. What you're feeling on the surface may not be related to the underlying problem. It's like an onion—you have to peel back the layers to find what's really going on.

**The surface problem:** I hate college. I don't belong here. I'm not smart enough for this.

**The real problem:** I believe I am less capable than other people and therefore do not deserve the experiences I am having.

## What Is a False Belief?

A false belief is a deep-seated, incorrect belief that's causing surface-level pain. It's usually something you've internalized over time, often without realizing it.

**Common false beliefs in depression:**
- "I am not worthy of love"
- "I am fundamentally broken"
- "I don't deserve good things"
- "I am not as capable as other people"
- "People are better off without me"
- "I will always be this way"
- "I am a burden to others"
- "I am not enough"

These beliefs are usually formed early in life, often as a result of difficult experiences or messages you received from others. They become so deeply ingrained that you don't even realize they're there—they just feel like the truth.

## Why Surface Solutions Don't Work

This is why so many people struggle with depression despite trying various treatments and strategies. **You can't fix what you don't understand.**

If you think the problem is college, you might try changing schools or dropping out. But if the real problem is a false belief about your capabilities, you'll just carry that belief with you wherever you go.

If you think the problem is your job, you might try changing careers. But if the real problem is a false belief about your worth, you'll just find the same struggles in a new environment.

**The key insight:** You have to address the false belief, not just the surface circumstances.

## The Process of Identification

Finding your false beliefs isn't easy, but it's crucial for lasting recovery. Here's the process I learned:

### Step 1: Find Someone to Talk Openly With
You need someone who will challenge your opinions and force you to further define and defend them. This might be a therapist, a trusted friend, a family member, or a life coach.

**The right person will:**
- Ask probing questions
- Challenge your assumptions
- Help you dig deeper
- Not let you off the hook with surface answers

### Step 2: Vocally Articulate Your Feelings
By talking through why you feel a certain way and learning how to articulate those feelings with words, you will begin to accurately identify the source of your pain.

**Start with:** "I feel [emotion] about [situation] because [reason]."

**Then ask:** "Is this really about [situation], or is it about something deeper?"

### Step 3: Write It Down
Once you identify a false belief, write it down. Having those emotions clearly defined in words is worth its weight in gold when it comes to comprehending how to overcome the difficulties you're facing in life.

**Example:** "I believe that I am less capable than other people and therefore do not deserve the experiences I am having."

### Step 4: Be Honest
You may get the source wrong a hundred times. But as you continue to be vulnerable and peel back your emotions, layer by layer, while seeking with sincerity, you will find the false belief that is causing flawed perceptions of yourself or the world around you.

## The College Conversation: A Real Example

Let me walk you through the conversation that changed everything for me:

**Me:** "I hate college. I don't belong here. I'm not smart enough for this."

**My Dad:** "Do you feel like you're doing your best in college?"

**Me:** "No."

**My Dad:** "Would someone else do better than you?"

**Me:** "Yes."

**My Dad:** "What you are feeling is a lack of confidence and self-worth, it has nothing to do with college and everything to do with how you perceive yourself and your efforts."

**The false belief I discovered:** "I believe that I am less capable than other people and therefore do not deserve the experiences I am having."

## Common False Beliefs in Depression

Based on my experience and the conversations I've had with others, here are some of the most common false beliefs that contribute to depression:

### "I Am Not Worthy of Love"
This belief often stems from early experiences of rejection or abandonment. It can manifest as pushing people away, avoiding relationships, or staying in unhealthy relationships.

### "I Am Fundamentally Broken"
This belief usually comes from internalizing negative messages about yourself. It can lead to feelings of hopelessness and the belief that you can't be fixed.

### "I Don't Deserve Good Things"
This belief often develops when you've experienced hardship or trauma. It can prevent you from pursuing opportunities or accepting help when it's offered.

### "I Am Not as Capable as Other People"
This belief can develop from comparing yourself to others or receiving critical messages about your abilities. It can lead to self-sabotage and avoidance of challenges.

### "People Are Better Off Without Me"
This belief often develops from feeling like a burden to others. It can lead to isolation and the belief that your presence makes things worse.

## What to Do Once You Find It

Identifying your false belief is just the beginning. Here's what comes next:

### 1. Acknowledge It
The first step is simply acknowledging that this belief exists and that it's not true. This can be incredibly difficult because false beliefs often feel like fundamental truths.

### 2. Challenge It
Start questioning the belief. Is it really true? What evidence do you have for it? What evidence do you have against it?

### 3. Reframe It
Work on developing a more accurate and helpful belief. This might be:
- "I am worthy of love and connection"
- "I am capable of growth and change"
- "I deserve good things in my life"
- "I have unique strengths and abilities"
- "My presence adds value to others' lives"

### 4. Build Evidence
Start collecting evidence that supports your new belief. This might be:
- Compliments you receive
- Accomplishments you achieve
- Positive relationships you build
- Challenges you overcome

### 5. Practice Self-Compassion
Be patient with yourself as you work to change these deeply ingrained beliefs. It takes time and practice.

## The Power of a Coach or Mentor

I can't overstate the importance of having someone who can help you think through these problems. The right person will know how to help you delve deeper into your emotions and discover their source.

**What to look for in a coach or mentor:**
- Someone who asks good questions
- Someone who challenges your assumptions
- Someone who doesn't let you off the hook
- Someone who believes in your potential
- Someone who has experience with mental health

## The Journey Forward

Finding and addressing your false beliefs is a lifelong journey. You might discover new ones as you grow and change. The important thing is to keep seeking, keep questioning, and keep growing.

**Remember:**
- You are not your false beliefs
- You are capable of change
- You deserve love and connection
- You are worthy of good things
- You are enough

The goal isn't to never have false beliefs again. The goal is to recognize them, challenge them, and choose more helpful beliefs instead.

## A Final Thought

The conversation with my father didn't magically fix my depression. It didn't make college suddenly easy or enjoyable. But it did something more important: **it gave me clarity about what I was really dealing with.**

Once I understood that the problem wasn't college but my false belief about my capabilities, I could start working on the real issue. I could start building evidence that I was capable. I could start challenging the belief that I didn't deserve to be there.

**The clarity you gain by understanding the source of your pain is fundamentally connected to your capacity to comprehend and therefore resolve that pain.**
