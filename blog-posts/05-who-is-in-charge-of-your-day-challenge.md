# The 'Who Is in Charge of Your Day?' Challenge: A 30-Day Depression Recovery Practice

*Every morning in middle school, my parents made me answer one question before leaving the house...*

---

## The Question That Changed Everything

Growing up, I would either take the bus or get a ride from my parents to school. Without fail, before we parted ways in the morning, they would always ask me a question. Many mornings, I wanted to try to avoid the question, get out of the car quickly enough that I wouldn't need to answer, or run down the driveway on the way to the bus to escape.

But without fail—either by chasing me down or simply rolling down the car window—they would yell out: **"Rosson! Who is in charge of your day?!"**

I would turn around and, depending on my mood, either say with power or as though I was admitting it to myself the following words: **"I AM!"**

There were days I didn't want to say it. Those were the days I needed to say it the most.

## Why This Simple Question Matters

This daily practice became the foundation of everything I learned about managing depression. It wasn't about denying that I was struggling or pretending everything was fine. It was about remembering that even in my darkest moments, I still had agency. I still had choices. I was still the main character in my story.

**Today, this is a practice that I regift to myself each day by asking myself the same question. Who is in charge of my day?**

On my hardest days, I remind myself that I'm in charge of my day and I choose one simple but productive task like making my bed that has the potential to create a snowball effect of productivity in my day.

## The 30-Day Challenge

I want to share this practice with you through a 30-day challenge. This isn't about fixing your depression overnight—it's about building a foundation of tenacity and self-belief that can support you through the difficult times.

### Week 1: Just Say It (Even If You Don't Mean It)

**Days 1-7: The Foundation**

For the first week, your only job is to ask yourself the question and answer it. That's it. No pressure to feel better, no expectation of immediate change. Just the practice.

**Daily Practice:**
1. When you wake up (or whenever you remember), ask yourself: "Who is in charge of my day?"
2. Answer out loud: "I AM!"
3. Notice how it feels to say it, even if you don't believe it yet

**Why this works:** On the surface, tenacity is simple, but in the moment, it can be difficult to plan small tasks that generate momentum. By starting with just the question and answer, you're building the neural pathways of self-belief without overwhelming yourself.

### Week 2: Add One Productive Task

**Days 8-14: Building Momentum**

Now that you're comfortable with the question, it's time to add one small productive task to your morning routine.

**Daily Practice:**
1. Ask: "Who is in charge of my day?"
2. Answer: "I AM!"
3. Choose one simple productive task (like making your bed, brushing your teeth, or taking a shower)
4. Complete that task, no matter how you feel

**Why this works:** One small task has the potential to create a snowball effect of productivity in your day. When you complete something, even something small, you prove to yourself that you can still take action, even when you don't feel like it.

### Week 3: Notice When Things Go Wrong and Recalibrate

**Days 15-21: The Pause and Reset**

This week, you'll learn what to do when things don't go according to plan—because they won't. And that's okay.

**Daily Practice:**
1. Ask: "Who is in charge of my day?"
2. Answer: "I AM!"
3. Complete your chosen task
4. When something goes wrong, pause and use the reset technique

**The Reset Technique:**
When something in your day goes awry, pause for a moment. Remember who is in charge of your day. Recall your intentions for the future and believe in them. Close your eyes, take a deep breath, exhale slowly, and smile.

This new problem you are facing may be uncomfortable or present strange unknowns, but those difficulties will be for your gain as you work through them. **The stronger the wind, the stronger the tree. Rise up and overcome your challenges. You are in control and you are amazing.**

### Week 4: Build Your Gratitude Practice

**Days 22-30: The Foundation Trinity**

In the final week, you'll add gratitude to your practice, completing the foundation of tenacity, gratitude, and responsibility.

**Daily Practice:**
1. Ask: "Who is in charge of my day?"
2. Answer: "I AM!"
3. Complete your chosen task
4. Practice the gratitude exercise

**The Gratitude Exercise:**
- Identify at least one painful experience you've had
- Assess what you learned from that experience
- What strengths have come from this experience?
- Maybe you were able to empathize with and help others going through a similar experience?
- By extracting these perceptions, you are choosing to redefine and find gratitude in an experience

## The Science Behind the Practice

This practice works because it addresses the three core principles that underpin all mental health frameworks:

### 1. Tenacity is the Mindset
By asking "Who is in charge of my day?" and answering "I AM!" you're reinforcing the belief that you have agency, even when you don't feel like it.

### 2. Gratitude is the Choice
By reframing your past experiences through gratitude, you're training your brain to see challenges as opportunities for growth rather than sources of pain.

### 3. Responsibility is the Reward
As you begin to apply a tenacious and gratitude-filled approach to life, you start to see responsibility not as a burden, but as an opportunity to create the future you want.

## Common Challenges and How to Overcome Them

### "I don't believe it when I say it"
That's okay. You don't have to believe it for it to work. The practice is about building the neural pathways of self-belief, not about feeling confident immediately.

### "I forget to do it"
Set a reminder on your phone or put a sticky note on your mirror. The goal is to make it a habit, and habits take time to build.

### "It doesn't work"
This practice isn't about fixing your depression overnight. It's about building a foundation that can support you through difficult times. Be patient with yourself.

### "I feel silly saying it out loud"
You can say it in your head if you prefer. The important thing is that you're asking the question and giving yourself the answer.

## Tracking Your Progress

Keep a simple journal of your practice. You don't need to write paragraphs—just a few notes about how each day went.

**Sample entries:**
- Day 1: Said it, didn't believe it, but did it
- Day 5: Starting to feel a little more confident
- Day 10: Completed my task even though I didn't want to
- Day 15: Used the reset technique when I got bad news
- Day 20: Feeling more in control of my day
- Day 25: Gratitude exercise is getting easier
- Day 30: This practice has become a habit

## What Happens After 30 Days?

After 30 days, you'll have built a foundation of tenacity and self-belief that can support you through difficult times. You'll have proven to yourself that you can take action even when you don't feel like it. You'll have started to reframe your past experiences through gratitude.

**But here's the thing: The work doesn't stop after 30 days.**

This practice is designed to become a lifelong habit. The goal isn't to eliminate depression entirely—it's to build the mental frameworks that help you manage it more effectively.

## The Bigger Picture

This simple daily practice is just the beginning. It's the foundation upon which all other mental health frameworks are built. Without tenacity, gratitude, and responsibility, the other strategies won't work as effectively.

**Remember:**
- You are in charge of your day
- You are in charge of your choices
- You are in charge of your story
- You are amazing

The goal isn't to never struggle with depression again. The goal is to build the mental strength and resilience to weather the storms and come out stronger on the other side.

**You've got this. And you're not alone in this journey.**
