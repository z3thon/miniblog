# Why Do I Feel Like a Different Person When I'm Depressed?

*If you've ever looked in the mirror during a depressive episode and not recognized the person staring back, you're not alone.*

## The Mirror Test

It's 2 PM on a Tuesday. You've been in bed since yesterday. Your phone is dead, your room is a mess, and you're staring at yourself in the bathroom mirror wondering: *Who is this person?*

The face looking back at you feels foreign. The eyes are hollow. The expression is empty. This isn't the person your friends know. This isn't the person who was excited about that project last week. This isn't you.

But here's the thing—that feeling of not recognizing yourself during depression? It's actually one of the most common experiences people have with cyclical depression. And understanding why this happens might be the key to reclaiming your identity.

## The Identity Theft of Depression

During my worst depressive episodes in college, I would follow the same destructive pattern every single time. I'd lie in bed for days, letting my thoughts spiral downward, often thinking about how much simpler life would be if I simply didn't exist. Then, I would try to put those thoughts into practice.

I would disappear. Do the bare minimum to get by. Avoid the people who loved me. Ghost my friends. Sabotage my own progress. And without fail, I'd always end up worse than before.

But here's what I didn't realize at the time: *That version of me wasn't me at all.*

It was my Evil Doppelgänger.

## The Evil Doppelgänger: A Game-Changing Realization

This realization—that the destructive version of myself was a separate character in my story—became one of my greatest weapons in fighting depression. When I stopped identifying with that destructive version of myself and began treating him like a separate character, I reclaimed power over who I was and who I wanted to be.

Your Evil Doppelgänger is not a reflection of you. It emerges when you're low, but it isn't who you are. It doesn't have your best interests at heart. It will try to tear you down, isolate you, waste your time, and ruin your relationships. It wants you to believe that you're unworthy, undeserving, unlovable, and hopeless.

But here's the real truth: **You are not the sum of your lowest moments, and you never have to carry the thoughts of what you did around with you while under their influence.**

## 5 Signs Depression Has Stolen Your Identity

If you're reading this and nodding along, here are the telltale signs that your depression might be masquerading as your identity:

### 1. You Avoid People Who Know "The Real You"
When you're in a depressive episode, you don't want to be around people who've seen you at your best. It feels like too much pressure to be that person right now, so you isolate yourself from those who know your true self.

### 2. You Make Choices You'd Normally Never Make
The person who emerges during depression makes decisions that your "normal" self would never consider. You might ghost friends, skip important commitments, or engage in self-destructive behaviors that feel completely out of character.

### 3. You Can't Remember Who You Were Before Depression
When you're in the thick of it, it's hard to remember what it felt like to be happy, motivated, or excited about life. The person you were before depression feels like a distant memory or even a lie.

### 4. You Feel Like You're Acting When Things Are Good
On the rare days when you feel better, it can feel like you're performing or pretending to be the person others expect you to be. The "real" you feels like a facade.

### 5. You Carry Guilt for Actions Done While Depressed
You might be carrying around shame and guilt for things you did or said during depressive episodes, believing these actions define who you are as a person.

## The Power of Dissociation

Here's where things get interesting. When I started treating my depressive patterns as a separate character—my Evil Doppelgänger—everything changed. I was finally able to stop conflating his actions with my identity.

Like a great heroic film with an amazing cast and well-scripted arch-nemesis, your Evil Doppelgänger seeks your destruction. They will have a compelling backstory and reasons to make you want to believe what they say to you. But to overcome them, your job will not be to fix or redeem them. **Your job is to dissociate from them.**

They don't get to define you anymore.

## The First Step: Reclaiming Control

So how do you start reclaiming your identity from depression's grip? It begins with a simple question that my parents used to ask me every morning before school:

**"Who is in charge of your day?"**

The answer, no matter how you feel, is always: **"I AM!"**

This isn't about denying that depression exists or pretending you're not struggling. It's about remembering that even in your darkest moments, you still have agency. You still have choices. You are still the main character in your story.

## A Framework for Identity Recovery

The process of reclaiming your identity from depression involves three key steps:

### 1. Recognize the Pattern
Start noticing when your Evil Doppelgänger is running the show. What behaviors does he engage in? What thoughts does he whisper? What actions does he take that don't align with who you want to be?

### 2. Dissociate from the Pattern
Remember: You are not your depression. The actions you take while depressed are not a reflection of your true character. They're the actions of a destructive pattern that you can learn to recognize and separate from.

### 3. Rebuild Your Identity
Use the space created by dissociation to paint a picture of who you believe you really are and the person you want to become. What values do you hold? What kind of friend do you want to be? What kind of life do you want to build?

## The Journey Forward

Reclaiming your identity from depression isn't a one-time event—it's an ongoing practice. Some days will be easier than others. Some days, your Evil Doppelgänger will try to convince you that he's the real you. But with practice, you'll get better at recognizing him, dissociating from him, and choosing to be the person you want to be instead.

The goal isn't to eliminate depression entirely (though that would be nice). The goal is to understand that depression doesn't define you. It's a pattern that you can learn to recognize, manage, and ultimately master.

You are not the sum of your lowest moments. You are not your Evil Doppelgänger. You are the person who gets up every day and chooses to be in charge of your day, even when it's hard.

**You are the main character in your story.**
