*College was supposed to be the best years of my life. Instead, it became a masterclass in depression.*

## The College Depression Paradox

There I was, lying on the grass outside my apartment at midnight, crying while staring at the stars, wondering: *How did I get here?*

I had done much harder things before—like living in a foreign country for two years. So why was college so much more difficult? Why was I struggling with depression in a place that was supposed to be full of opportunity, growth, and new experiences?

It took me two years to figure it out: **College was cannibalizing every single depressive trigger I had.**

## Why College Can Make Depression Worse

If you're a college student reading this and feeling like you're failing at something that should be exciting, I want you to know something: It's not your fault. College presents a unique set of challenges that can trigger or worsen depression, especially if you're already prone to cyclical depressive episodes.

Here's what I discovered about why college can be so difficult for people dealing with depression:

### 1. The Lack of Human Connection
In college, you're often working hard on assignments and projects, but you rarely get to see the direct impact of your efforts. Professors grade your work, but they don't see the process. They don't know you personally. The human connection that makes work meaningful is often missing.

This was my second biggest trigger: *Exerting effort while lacking a human connection with those I am exerting the effort on behalf of.*

### 2. Constant Performance Pressure
Every assignment, every test, every project feels like it's building toward your future. The pressure to perform can be overwhelming, especially when you're already struggling with self-worth and confidence.

### 3. Isolation from Support Systems
For the first time in your life, you might be away from the people who know you best—your family, your childhood friends, your support network. When depression hits, you don't have the same safety net you've always relied on.

### 4. The Comparison Trap
You're surrounded by peers who seem to be thriving. Social media shows everyone else having the time of their lives while you're struggling to get out of bed. The comparison can be devastating.

### 5. Environmental Triggers
Your living situation, roommate dynamics, social circles, and daily responsibilities all impact your mental health in ways you might not realize.

## The Four Environmental Factors That Impact Student Mental Health

Through my own struggles, I learned that your environment has a massive impact on your ability to manage depressive episodes. Here are the four key factors, ranked from most to least impactful:

### 1. Roommates/Spouse (Most Impactful)
Who you live with matters more than almost anything else. I learned with each roommate that my capacity to manage my emotions varied greatly based on who I was with. Since leaving my parents and siblings, my emotions were often volatile and unexpected.

**What you can do:** If your living situation is toxic, start planning to change it. Look for new roommates, different housing options, or ways to spend more time in supportive environments.

### 2. Community
Your friend groups and social circles heavily influence your personality and the decisions you choose to make. If you surround yourself with people who don't bring out the best in you, it will be much harder to manage depression.

**What you can do:** Seek out people who inspire you, challenge you in healthy ways, and support your growth. Join clubs, study groups, or activities that align with your values.

### 3. Responsibilities
Your academic workload, part-time job, or other obligations can either support or hinder your mental health. Too much pressure without adequate support can trigger depressive episodes.

**What you can do:** Be realistic about your capacity. It's okay to drop a class, reduce your course load, or ask for extensions when you're struggling.

### 4. Entertainment (Least Impactful, But Still Important)
The availability of vices versus healthy activities in your environment can make a big difference. Easy access to video games, social media, or other distractions can enable avoidance behaviors.

**What you can do:** Create an environment that supports your best self. Limit access to vices and increase access to activities that make you feel good about yourself.

## Practical Strategies for College Students

Based on my own experience and the frameworks I developed, here are some practical strategies for managing depression in college:

### 1. Design "Trap Cards" for Dorm Life
A Trap Card is a pre-planned strategy that activates when you're in a depressive state. The key is to plan these when you're feeling good, not when you're already struggling.

**My most effective Trap Card in college:**
- **Step 1:** Call my mom and admit I was struggling (the hardest part)
- **Step 2:** Walk outside and get some fresh air
- **Step 3:** Watch a portion of Disney's Treasure Planet while processing my emotions
- **Step 4:** Make a plan to address whatever was causing the depression

**Create your own Trap Card:**
- Identify the first painful step (usually taking responsibility)
- Plan an emotional release activity
- Design a recovery action
- If your depression fights planning it, it'll work especially well

### 2. The Sunday Night Phone Call Ritual
Every Sunday night, I would call my parents and give them an honest update about how I was doing. This created accountability and gave me a safe space to process my emotions and challenges.

**How to implement:**
- Choose a consistent time each week
- Be honest about your struggles
- Ask for their perspective and advice
- Use it as a planning session for the week ahead

### 3. Create Accountability with Roommates
If you have a good relationship with your roommate, consider sharing your struggle with depression. You can ask them to check in on you or even intervene when they notice concerning patterns.

**What to say:** "I sometimes struggle with depression, and I might not always recognize when I'm in a bad place. Would you be willing to check in on me if you notice I'm isolating myself or acting differently?"

### 4. Recognize Symptoms Earlier
The goal is to recognize when you're entering a depressive state before it takes full hold. This allows you to intervene with your Trap Cards more effectively.

**Early warning signs to watch for:**
- Avoiding social interactions
- Skipping classes or assignments
- Changes in sleep or eating patterns
- Increased use of distractions (gaming, social media)
- Negative self-talk or hopeless thoughts

### 5. Master Your Cycles
Think of managing depression like a sport. The goal isn't to eliminate the challenge entirely—it's to get better at recognizing it, responding to it, and recovering from it.

**Track your patterns:**
- How long do your depressive episodes typically last?
- What triggers them?
- What helps you recover faster?
- How can you improve your response time?

## The Bigger Picture

Here's what I want you to know: College doesn't have to destroy you. It can actually become a masterclass in learning how to manage depression and build emotional resilience.

For me, those difficult years in college taught me more about myself and my mental health than any other experience. They forced me to develop the frameworks and strategies that I still use today. They showed me what I needed in my life to overcome depression.

**The goal isn't to eliminate depression entirely—it's to understand it, manage it, and ultimately master it.**
