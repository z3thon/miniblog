# Why Do I Feel Like a Different Person When I'm Depressed?

*If you've ever looked in the mirror during a depressive episode and not recognized the person staring back, you're not alone.*

---

## The Mirror Test

It's 2 PM on a Tuesday. You've been in bed since yesterday. Your phone is dead, your room is a mess, and you're staring at yourself in the bathroom mirror wondering: *Who is this person?*

The face looking back at you feels foreign. The eyes are hollow. The expression is empty. This isn't the person your friends know. This isn't the person who was excited about that project last week. This isn't you.

But here's the thing—that feeling of not recognizing yourself during depression? It's actually one of the most common experiences people have with cyclical depression. And understanding why this happens might be the key to reclaiming your identity.

## The Identity Theft of Depression

During my worst depressive episodes in college, I would follow the same destructive pattern every single time. I'd lie in bed for days, letting my thoughts spiral downward, often thinking about how much simpler life would be if I simply didn't exist. Then, I would try to put those thoughts into practice.

I would disappear. Do the bare minimum to get by. Avoid the people who loved me. Ghost my friends. Sabotage my own progress. And without fail, I'd always end up worse than before.

But here's what I didn't realize at the time: *That version of me wasn't me at all.*

It was my Evil Doppelgänger.

## The Evil Doppelgänger: A Game-Changing Realization

This realization—that the destructive version of myself was a separate character in my story—became one of my greatest weapons in fighting depression. When I stopped identifying with that destructive version of myself and began treating him like a separate character, I reclaimed power over who I was and who I wanted to be.

Your Evil Doppelgänger is not a reflection of you. It emerges when you're low, but it isn't who you are. It doesn't have your best interests at heart. It will try to tear you down, isolate you, waste your time, and ruin your relationships. It wants you to believe that you're unworthy, undeserving, unlovable, and hopeless.

But here's the real truth: **You are not the sum of your lowest moments, and you never have to carry the thoughts of what you did around with you while under their influence.**

## 5 Signs Depression Has Stolen Your Identity

If you're reading this and nodding along, here are the telltale signs that your depression might be masquerading as your identity:

### 1. You Avoid People Who Know "The Real You"
When you're in a depressive episode, you don't want to be around people who've seen you at your best. It feels like too much pressure to be that person right now, so you isolate yourself from those who know your true self.

### 2. You Make Choices You'd Normally Never Make
The person who emerges during depression makes decisions that your "normal" self would never consider. You might ghost friends, skip important commitments, or engage in self-destructive behaviors that feel completely out of character.

### 3. You Can't Remember Who You Were Before Depression
When you're in the thick of it, it's hard to remember what it felt like to be happy, motivated, or excited about life. The person you were before depression feels like a distant memory or even a lie.

### 4. You Feel Like You're Acting When Things Are Good
On the rare days when you feel better, it can feel like you're performing or pretending to be the person others expect you to be. The "real" you feels like a facade.

### 5. You Carry Guilt for Actions Done While Depressed
You might be carrying around shame and guilt for things you did or said during depressive episodes, believing these actions define who you are as a person.

## The Power of Dissociation

Here's where things get interesting. When I started treating my depressive patterns as a separate character—my Evil Doppelgänger—everything changed. I was finally able to stop conflating his actions with my identity.

Like a great heroic film with an amazing cast and well-scripted arch-nemesis, your Evil Doppelgänger seeks your destruction. They will have a compelling backstory and reasons to make you want to believe what they say to you. But to overcome them, your job will not be to fix or redeem them. **Your job is to dissociate from them.**

They don't get to define you anymore.

## The First Step: Reclaiming Control

So how do you start reclaiming your identity from depression's grip? It begins with a simple question that my parents used to ask me every morning before school:

**"Who is in charge of your day?"**

The answer, no matter how you feel, is always: **"I AM!"**

This isn't about denying that depression exists or pretending you're not struggling. It's about remembering that even in your darkest moments, you still have agency. You still have choices. You are still the main character in your story.

## A Framework for Identity Recovery

The process of reclaiming your identity from depression involves three key steps:

### 1. Recognize the Pattern
Start noticing when your Evil Doppelgänger is running the show. What behaviors does he engage in? What thoughts does he whisper? What actions does he take that don't align with who you want to be?

### 2. Dissociate from the Pattern
Remember: You are not your depression. The actions you take while depressed are not a reflection of your true character. They're the actions of a destructive pattern that you can learn to recognize and separate from.

### 3. Rebuild Your Identity
Use the space created by dissociation to paint a picture of who you believe you really are and the person you want to become. What values do you hold? What kind of friend do you want to be? What kind of life do you want to build?

## The Journey Forward

Reclaiming your identity from depression isn't a one-time event—it's an ongoing practice. Some days will be easier than others. Some days, your Evil Doppelgänger will try to convince you that he's the real you. But with practice, you'll get better at recognizing him, dissociating from him, and choosing to be the person you want to be instead.

The goal isn't to eliminate depression entirely (though that would be nice). The goal is to understand that depression doesn't define you. It's a pattern that you can learn to recognize, manage, and ultimately master.

You are not the sum of your lowest moments. You are not your Evil Doppelgänger. You are the person who gets up every day and chooses to be in charge of your day, even when it's hard.

**You are the main character in your story.**

## The College Depression Paradox

There I was, lying on the grass outside my apartment at midnight, crying while staring at the stars, wondering: *How did I get here?*

I had done much harder things before—like living in a foreign country for two years. So why was college so much more difficult? Why was I struggling with depression in a place that was supposed to be full of opportunity, growth, and new experiences?

It took me two years to figure it out: **College was cannibalizing every single depressive trigger I had.**

## Why College Can Make Depression Worse

If you're a college student reading this and feeling like you're failing at something that should be exciting, I want you to know something: It's not your fault. College presents a unique set of challenges that can trigger or worsen depression, especially if you're already prone to cyclical depressive episodes.

Here's what I discovered about why college can be so difficult for people dealing with depression:

### 1. The Lack of Human Connection
In college, you're often working hard on assignments and projects, but you rarely get to see the direct impact of your efforts. Professors grade your work, but they don't see the process. They don't know you personally. The human connection that makes work meaningful is often missing.

This was my second biggest trigger: *Exerting effort while lacking a human connection with those I am exerting the effort on behalf of.*

### 2. Constant Performance Pressure
Every assignment, every test, every project feels like it's building toward your future. The pressure to perform can be overwhelming, especially when you're already struggling with self-worth and confidence.

### 3. Isolation from Support Systems
For the first time in your life, you might be away from the people who know you best—your family, your childhood friends, your support network. When depression hits, you don't have the same safety net you've always relied on.

### 4. The Comparison Trap
You're surrounded by peers who seem to be thriving. Social media shows everyone else having the time of their lives while you're struggling to get out of bed. The comparison can be devastating.

### 5. Environmental Triggers
Your living situation, roommate dynamics, social circles, and daily responsibilities all impact your mental health in ways you might not realize.

## The Four Environmental Factors That Impact Student Mental Health

Through my own struggles, I learned that your environment has a massive impact on your ability to manage depressive episodes. Here are the four key factors, ranked from most to least impactful:

### 1. Roommates/Spouse (Most Impactful)
Who you live with matters more than almost anything else. I learned with each roommate that my capacity to manage my emotions varied greatly based on who I was with. Since leaving my parents and siblings, my emotions were often volatile and unexpected.

**What you can do:** If your living situation is toxic, start planning to change it. Look for new roommates, different housing options, or ways to spend more time in supportive environments.

### 2. Community
Your friend groups and social circles heavily influence your personality and the decisions you choose to make. If you surround yourself with people who don't bring out the best in you, it will be much harder to manage depression.

**What you can do:** Seek out people who inspire you, challenge you in healthy ways, and support your growth. Join clubs, study groups, or activities that align with your values.

### 3. Responsibilities
Your academic workload, part-time job, or other obligations can either support or hinder your mental health. Too much pressure without adequate support can trigger depressive episodes.

**What you can do:** Be realistic about your capacity. It's okay to drop a class, reduce your course load, or ask for extensions when you're struggling.

### 4. Entertainment (Least Impactful, But Still Important)
The availability of vices versus healthy activities in your environment can make a big difference. Easy access to video games, social media, or other distractions can enable avoidance behaviors.

**What you can do:** Create an environment that supports your best self. Limit access to vices and increase access to activities that make you feel good about yourself.

## Practical Strategies for College Students

Based on my own experience and the frameworks I developed, here are some practical strategies for managing depression in college:

### 1. Design "Trap Cards" for Dorm Life
A Trap Card is a pre-planned strategy that activates when you're in a depressive state. The key is to plan these when you're feeling good, not when you're already struggling.

**My most effective Trap Card in college:**
- **Step 1:** Call my mom and admit I was struggling (the hardest part)
- **Step 2:** Walk outside and get some fresh air
- **Step 3:** Watch a portion of Disney's Treasure Planet while processing my emotions
- **Step 4:** Make a plan to address whatever was causing the depression

**Create your own Trap Card:**
- Identify the first painful step (usually taking responsibility)
- Plan an emotional release activity
- Design a recovery action
- If your depression fights planning it, it'll work especially well

### 2. The Sunday Night Phone Call Ritual
Every Sunday night, I would call my parents and give them an honest update about how I was doing. This created accountability and gave me a safe space to process my emotions and challenges.

**How to implement:**
- Choose a consistent time each week
- Be honest about your struggles
- Ask for their perspective and advice
- Use it as a planning session for the week ahead

### 3. Create Accountability with Roommates
If you have a good relationship with your roommate, consider sharing your struggle with depression. You can ask them to check in on you or even intervene when they notice concerning patterns.

**What to say:** "I sometimes struggle with depression, and I might not always recognize when I'm in a bad place. Would you be willing to check in on me if you notice I'm isolating myself or acting differently?"

### 4. Recognize Symptoms Earlier
The goal is to recognize when you're entering a depressive state before it takes full hold. This allows you to intervene with your Trap Cards more effectively.

**Early warning signs to watch for:**
- Avoiding social interactions
- Skipping classes or assignments
- Changes in sleep or eating patterns
- Increased use of distractions (gaming, social media)
- Negative self-talk or hopeless thoughts

### 5. Master Your Cycles
Think of managing depression like a sport. The goal isn't to eliminate the challenge entirely—it's to get better at recognizing it, responding to it, and recovering from it.

**Track your patterns:**
- How long do your depressive episodes typically last?
- What triggers them?
- What helps you recover faster?
- How can you improve your response time?

## When to Take Action

If you're struggling with depression in college, here are some signs it's time to take more serious action:

### Immediate Actions (This Week):
- Talk to someone you trust about what you're experiencing
- Visit your campus counseling center
- Consider reducing your course load
- Create your first Trap Card

### Short-term Actions (This Month):
- Evaluate your living situation and make changes if needed
- Build a support network of friends who understand
- Develop a consistent self-care routine
- Learn more about depression and mental health

### Long-term Actions (This Semester):
- Consider therapy or counseling
- Explore medication options with a healthcare provider
- Plan for a supportive environment after graduation
- Build skills and frameworks for long-term mental health

## The Bigger Picture

Here's what I want you to know: College doesn't have to destroy you. It can actually become a masterclass in learning how to manage depression and build emotional resilience.

For me, those difficult years in college taught me more about myself and my mental health than any other experience. They forced me to develop the frameworks and strategies that I still use today. They showed me what I needed in my life to overcome depression.

**The goal isn't to eliminate depression entirely—it's to understand it, manage it, and ultimately master it.**

## You're Not Alone

If you're reading this and feeling overwhelmed, please know that you're not alone. Depression in college is more common than you might think, and there are people who want to help you through it.

**Resources for College Students:**
- Campus counseling centers (often free or low-cost)
- National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 988
- Crisis Text Line: Text HOME to 741741
- Your RA or residence life staff
- Academic advisors who can help with course planning

## The Journey Forward

Managing depression in college isn't easy, but it's possible. With the right frameworks, support systems, and strategies, you can not only survive college but thrive in it.

The key is to start small, be patient with yourself, and remember that you're in charge of your day—even when it doesn't feel like it.

**You've got this. And you're not alone in this fight.**

# What Is 'Bed-Rotting' and Why You Can't Stop Doing It

*It's 3 PM. You've been in bed since yesterday. Your phone is at 10%. You're not even watching anything good anymore.*

---

## The Bed-Rotting Phenomenon

You know the drill. You wake up feeling heavy, like your body is made of lead. The idea of getting up and facing the day feels impossible. So you don't. You stay in bed, scrolling through your phone, watching random videos, or just staring at the ceiling.

Hours pass. Maybe you eat something. Maybe you don't. The day slips away, and you're still there, in bed, feeling worse than when you started.

This is what I call "bed-rotting"—and if you're reading this, you probably know exactly what I'm talking about.

## Why It's Not Laziness

Here's the thing about bed-rotting: It's not laziness. It's not a character flaw. It's not you being dramatic or attention-seeking. It's a coping mechanism, albeit a destructive one.

When you're in a depressive state, your brain is trying to protect you from overwhelming emotions and situations. Staying in bed feels safe. It's a way to avoid the world that feels too big, too scary, too demanding.

But here's the problem: **Bed-rotting doesn't actually help. It just delays the inevitable.**

## The Psychology of Avoidance

I learned this the hard way during college. I would sit in front of my computer screen after playing games late into the night, the monitor illuminating our room at 3 AM. I'd glance back to see my roommate asleep behind me, and I'd realize I had been trying to escape what I perceived as an emotional doldrum through one of my favorite pastimes.

But here's what I didn't realize at the time: **My pastime had transitioned into a vice.**

I closed my computer and started getting ready for bed. Aside from the excitement I would feel while playing, I couldn't perceive any real improvement to my emotions after ending my gaming session. As if things couldn't get worse, staying up late would make it hard to focus in my classes tomorrow.

"Maybe I should just skip classes and try to reset my emotions," I thought to myself. "I won't get anything done feeling like this."

## The Vice Trap

Be it video games, browsing social media late into the night, or any other form of bed-rotting, life is full of vices that seek to distract us. They cause us to make poor use of our agency and present themselves as a form of escape.

It's in our nature to practice avoidance when it comes to mortal dangers, but this practice cannot help you escape emotional or mental trials and challenges. **They don't disappear over time; you only delay facing them.**

Vices dampen and delay painful emotions, but they do nothing to help us dismantle or overcome their source. While your vice may grant you a temporary reprieve, a downward spiral of emotions is beginning to wreak havoc on your mind the longer you continue to delay confronting the source of your pain.

It may not happen right away, but **emotions fester as you continue to avoid or dampen them.**

## The Doppelgänger Connection

Here's where things get interesting. Your bed-rotting behavior isn't really you—it's your Evil Doppelgänger at work.

Your Evil Doppelgänger wants you isolated. It wants you to waste time. It wants you to avoid the people and activities that might actually help you feel better. It wants you to believe that staying in bed is the only option.

**But here's the truth: They're not the main character. You are.**

## Breaking the Cycle

So how do you break out of the bed-rotting cycle? It starts with understanding that the first step is always the hardest, but it's also the most important.

### The Snowball Effect

One of the most powerful strategies I learned was the concept of the "snowball effect." When you're at your lowest, you don't need to tackle everything at once. You just need to do one small thing that can create momentum.

**Start with making your bed.**

I know it sounds trivial, but there's something powerful about completing one simple task. It proves to yourself that you can still take action, even when you don't feel like it. It creates a small sense of accomplishment that can build into something bigger.

### The "Who Is in Charge?" Question

Every morning, no matter how I felt, I would ask myself: "Who is in charge of my day?"

The answer, even when I didn't believe it, was always: "I AM!"

This simple practice reminded me that I still had agency, even in my darkest moments. I was still the main character in my story, even when my Evil Doppelgänger was trying to convince me otherwise.

### When Things Go Wrong

When something in your day goes awry, pause for a moment. Remember who is in charge of your day. Recall your intentions for the future and believe in them. Close your eyes, take a deep breath, exhale slowly, and smile.

This new problem you are facing may be uncomfortable or present strange unknowns, but those difficulties will be for your gain as you work through them. **The stronger the wind, the stronger the tree. Rise up and overcome your challenges. You are in control and you are amazing.**

## Designing Your First Trap Card

A Trap Card is a pre-planned strategy that activates when you're in a depressive state. The key is to design it when you're feeling good, not when you're already struggling.

**Here's how to create your first Trap Card:**

1. **Identify the first painful step** (usually taking responsibility for something)
2. **Plan an emotional release activity** (something that helps you process your feelings)
3. **Design a recovery action** (something that moves you forward)

**Example Trap Card:**
- **Step 1:** Call someone you trust and admit you're struggling
- **Step 2:** Go for a walk or do some light exercise
- **Step 3:** Do one productive task (like making your bed or cleaning your room)

**The key insight:** If your depression fights planning it, it'll work especially well. Your Evil Doppelgänger knows what you're trying to do and will try to convince you not to set the trap. This resistance is actually a green flag that your Trap Card will be effective.

## The Truth About Vices

Here's what I want you to understand about vices and bed-rotting: They're not inherently bad. The problem isn't the activity itself—it's how you're using it.

**Healthy entertainment:** You play video games or watch shows because you enjoy them, and they add value to your life.

**Vice behavior:** You play video games or watch shows to escape from your emotions, and they make you feel worse afterward.

The difference is in your intention and the outcome. If an activity is helping you avoid your feelings rather than process them, it's become a vice.

## Building a Better Environment

Your environment has a huge impact on your tendency to bed-rot. Here are the four key factors that influence your mental health:

1. **Who you live with** (most impactful)
2. **Your community and friend groups**
3. **Your responsibilities and obligations**
4. **The entertainment and vices available to you**

**Questions to ask yourself:**
- Does your living situation support your mental health?
- Are you surrounded by people who bring out your best self?
- Do your daily responsibilities feel manageable?
- Are you easily able to access healthy activities?

## The Journey Forward

Breaking the bed-rotting cycle isn't easy, but it's possible. It starts with recognizing that you're not lazy or weak—you're dealing with a real mental health challenge that requires real strategies.

**Remember:**
- You are not your lowest moments
- You are in charge of your day
- Small actions can create big changes
- You don't have to face this alone

The goal isn't to never feel like staying in bed again. The goal is to recognize when your Evil Doppelgänger is trying to isolate you and choose a different path instead.

**You are the main character in your story. You get to decide how it goes.**

# How to Stop Ghosting Your Friends When Depression Hits

*The notifications pile up. You read them, but don't respond. Days turn to weeks. Now it feels too late to reach out.*

---

## The Ghosting Spiral

It starts small. A text message you don't feel like answering. A missed call you'll return "later." A group chat that feels too overwhelming to engage with.

Then it grows. Days pass. Weeks pass. The notifications pile up, and the guilt builds. You want to reach out, but now it feels like too much has happened. What would you even say? How do you explain your absence?

So you don't. You continue ghosting, and the isolation deepens.

If this sounds familiar, you're not alone. Ghosting friends during depressive episodes is one of the most common and destructive patterns people with cyclical depression experience.

## Why Depression Makes Us Ghost

Understanding why depression drives us to isolate ourselves is the first step in breaking the pattern. Here's what's really happening:

### 1. Shame and Perceived Inadequacy
When you're depressed, you often feel like you're not good enough for the people in your life. You might believe that your friends are better off without you, or that you'll just bring them down with your problems.

### 2. Energy Depletion
Depression is exhausting. The idea of maintaining social connections, explaining how you're feeling, or pretending to be okay can feel overwhelming. It's easier to avoid social interaction entirely.

### 3. The Doppelgänger Wants Isolation
Your Evil Doppelgänger—that destructive version of yourself that emerges during depression—wants you isolated. It knows that social connection is one of your greatest weapons against depression, so it tries to convince you to push people away.

### 4. False Beliefs About Relationships
You might believe that your friends don't really care about you, that they're just being polite, or that they'll eventually abandon you anyway. These false beliefs make ghosting feel like the safer option.

### 5. The "Different Person" Problem
When you're depressed, you might feel like a completely different person than the one your friends know. The idea of showing them this "other" version of yourself can feel terrifying.

## The Damage Ghosting Does

The problem with ghosting friends during depression is that it creates a vicious cycle that makes everything worse:

### To Your Friendships
Your friends don't understand what's happening. They might feel hurt, confused, or even angry. They might start to question whether the friendship was real or if you were just pretending to care about them.

### To Your Sense of Identity
When you ghost people, you're reinforcing the false belief that you're not worthy of connection. This deepens the depression and makes it harder to reach out for help.

### To Your Support System
The people who care about you most are the ones you're pushing away. When you need support the most, you've isolated yourself from the very people who want to help you.

## You're Not Your Lowest Moments

Here's the most important thing to understand: **The person who ghosts friends during depression is not the real you.**

That version of you—the one who pushes people away, who isolates herself, who believes she's not worthy of love—is your Evil Doppelgänger. It's a destructive pattern that emerges when you're low, but it's not who you are.

**You are not the sum of your lowest moments, and you never have to carry the thoughts of what you did around with you while under their influence.**

## The Trap Card Solution

The key to breaking the ghosting pattern is to design what I call a "Trap Card"—a pre-planned strategy that activates when you're in a depressive state.

**Here's how to create your anti-ghosting Trap Card:**

### Step 1: Pre-Plan Your Outreach
When you're feeling good, identify 2-3 people you can reach out to when you're struggling. These should be people who understand your situation and won't judge you for disappearing.

### Step 2: Create a Template Message
Write a simple message you can send when you're in a bad place. It doesn't need to be long or detailed—just honest.

**Example template:**
"Hey, I've been struggling with depression lately and haven't been great at staying in touch. I'm not looking for advice, just wanted you to know I'm thinking about you and I'm sorry I've been distant."

### Step 3: Give Permission to Intervene
Ask your closest friends to check in on you if they notice you've been quiet for a while. Give them permission to reach out even if you don't respond right away.

**What to say:**
"I sometimes struggle with depression, and I might not always recognize when I'm in a bad place. Would you be willing to check in on me if you notice I've been quiet for a while? Even if I don't respond right away, it helps to know you're thinking about me."

### Step 4: Design Your Recovery Action
Plan what you'll do after reaching out. This might be:
- Going for a walk
- Doing something productive
- Calling someone you trust
- Engaging in a hobby you enjoy

## What to Say When You Come Back

If you've already ghosted someone and want to reconnect, here are some approaches that work:

### The Honest Approach
"Hey, I'm really sorry I've been distant. I've been struggling with depression and haven't been great at staying in touch. I miss our friendship and I'm ready to reconnect if you're willing."

### The Simple Approach
"Hi! I've been going through a rough patch and haven't been the best friend lately. I'm doing better now and would love to catch up. How are you?"

### The Grateful Approach
"Thank you for being patient with me while I've been dealing with some personal stuff. I'm grateful for your friendship and I'm ready to be a better friend to you."

## Building Long-Term Connection

Breaking the ghosting pattern is just the beginning. Here's how to build stronger, more resilient friendships:

### 1. Be Honest About Your Struggles
You don't have to share everything, but letting your friends know that you sometimes struggle with depression can help them understand when you're not yourself.

### 2. Set Realistic Expectations
Let your friends know that you might not always be available, but that doesn't mean you don't care about them. Set boundaries that work for both of you.

### 3. Create Accountability Systems
Ask a trusted friend to check in on you regularly. Give them permission to ask how you're doing and to encourage you to reach out when you're struggling.

### 4. Focus on Quality Over Quantity
It's better to have a few close friends who understand your situation than many acquaintances who don't. Invest in the relationships that matter most.

## The Power of Community

Here's something I learned the hard way: **Community is one of the most powerful weapons against depression.**

When I was struggling in college, my closest friends became my lifeline. They didn't always understand what I was going through, but they were there for me. They checked in on me. They encouraged me to reach out when I was struggling.

**The right people will want to help you, even when you're not at your best.**

## When to Seek Professional Help

If you find yourself consistently ghosting friends or struggling to maintain relationships, it might be time to seek professional help. A therapist or counselor can help you:

- Understand the root causes of your isolation
- Develop better communication skills
- Build healthier relationship patterns
- Address underlying mental health issues

## The Journey Forward

Breaking the ghosting pattern isn't easy, but it's possible. It starts with recognizing that you're not a bad friend—you're someone dealing with a real mental health challenge that requires real strategies.

**Remember:**
- You are not your lowest moments
- Your friends care about you, even when you're struggling
- It's never too late to reach out
- You deserve connection and support

The goal isn't to never struggle with depression again. The goal is to build relationships that can weather the storms and support you through the difficult times.

**You are worthy of love and connection, even when you don't feel like it.**

# The 'Who Is in Charge of Your Day?' Challenge: A 30-Day Depression Recovery Practice

*Every morning in middle school, my parents made me answer one question before leaving the house...*

---

## The Question That Changed Everything

Growing up, I would either take the bus or get a ride from my parents to school. Without fail, before we parted ways in the morning, they would always ask me a question. Many mornings, I wanted to try to avoid the question, get out of the car quickly enough that I wouldn't need to answer, or run down the driveway on the way to the bus to escape.

But without fail—either by chasing me down or simply rolling down the car window—they would yell out: **"Rosson! Who is in charge of your day?!"**

I would turn around and, depending on my mood, either say with power or as though I was admitting it to myself the following words: **"I AM!"**

There were days I didn't want to say it. Those were the days I needed to say it the most.

## Why This Simple Question Matters

This daily practice became the foundation of everything I learned about managing depression. It wasn't about denying that I was struggling or pretending everything was fine. It was about remembering that even in my darkest moments, I still had agency. I still had choices. I was still the main character in my story.

**Today, this is a practice that I regift to myself each day by asking myself the same question. Who is in charge of my day?**

On my hardest days, I remind myself that I'm in charge of my day and I choose one simple but productive task like making my bed that has the potential to create a snowball effect of productivity in my day.

## The 30-Day Challenge

I want to share this practice with you through a 30-day challenge. This isn't about fixing your depression overnight—it's about building a foundation of tenacity and self-belief that can support you through the difficult times.

### Week 1: Just Say It (Even If You Don't Mean It)

**Days 1-7: The Foundation**

For the first week, your only job is to ask yourself the question and answer it. That's it. No pressure to feel better, no expectation of immediate change. Just the practice.

**Daily Practice:**
1. When you wake up (or whenever you remember), ask yourself: "Who is in charge of my day?"
2. Answer out loud: "I AM!"
3. Notice how it feels to say it, even if you don't believe it yet

**Why this works:** On the surface, tenacity is simple, but in the moment, it can be difficult to plan small tasks that generate momentum. By starting with just the question and answer, you're building the neural pathways of self-belief without overwhelming yourself.

### Week 2: Add One Productive Task

**Days 8-14: Building Momentum**

Now that you're comfortable with the question, it's time to add one small productive task to your morning routine.

**Daily Practice:**
1. Ask: "Who is in charge of my day?"
2. Answer: "I AM!"
3. Choose one simple productive task (like making your bed, brushing your teeth, or taking a shower)
4. Complete that task, no matter how you feel

**Why this works:** One small task has the potential to create a snowball effect of productivity in your day. When you complete something, even something small, you prove to yourself that you can still take action, even when you don't feel like it.

### Week 3: Notice When Things Go Wrong and Recalibrate

**Days 15-21: The Pause and Reset**

This week, you'll learn what to do when things don't go according to plan—because they won't. And that's okay.

**Daily Practice:**
1. Ask: "Who is in charge of my day?"
2. Answer: "I AM!"
3. Complete your chosen task
4. When something goes wrong, pause and use the reset technique

**The Reset Technique:**
When something in your day goes awry, pause for a moment. Remember who is in charge of your day. Recall your intentions for the future and believe in them. Close your eyes, take a deep breath, exhale slowly, and smile.

This new problem you are facing may be uncomfortable or present strange unknowns, but those difficulties will be for your gain as you work through them. **The stronger the wind, the stronger the tree. Rise up and overcome your challenges. You are in control and you are amazing.**

### Week 4: Build Your Gratitude Practice

**Days 22-30: The Foundation Trinity**

In the final week, you'll add gratitude to your practice, completing the foundation of tenacity, gratitude, and responsibility.

**Daily Practice:**
1. Ask: "Who is in charge of my day?"
2. Answer: "I AM!"
3. Complete your chosen task
4. Practice the gratitude exercise

**The Gratitude Exercise:**
- Identify at least one painful experience you've had
- Assess what you learned from that experience
- What strengths have come from this experience?
- Maybe you were able to empathize with and help others going through a similar experience?
- By extracting these perceptions, you are choosing to redefine and find gratitude in an experience

## The Science Behind the Practice

This practice works because it addresses the three core principles that underpin all mental health frameworks:

### 1. Tenacity is the Mindset
By asking "Who is in charge of my day?" and answering "I AM!" you're reinforcing the belief that you have agency, even when you don't feel like it.

### 2. Gratitude is the Choice
By reframing your past experiences through gratitude, you're training your brain to see challenges as opportunities for growth rather than sources of pain.

### 3. Responsibility is the Reward
As you begin to apply a tenacious and gratitude-filled approach to life, you start to see responsibility not as a burden, but as an opportunity to create the future you want.

## Common Challenges and How to Overcome Them

### "I don't believe it when I say it"
That's okay. You don't have to believe it for it to work. The practice is about building the neural pathways of self-belief, not about feeling confident immediately.

### "I forget to do it"
Set a reminder on your phone or put a sticky note on your mirror. The goal is to make it a habit, and habits take time to build.

### "It doesn't work"
This practice isn't about fixing your depression overnight. It's about building a foundation that can support you through difficult times. Be patient with yourself.

### "I feel silly saying it out loud"
You can say it in your head if you prefer. The important thing is that you're asking the question and giving yourself the answer.

## Tracking Your Progress

Keep a simple journal of your practice. You don't need to write paragraphs—just a few notes about how each day went.

**Sample entries:**
- Day 1: Said it, didn't believe it, but did it
- Day 5: Starting to feel a little more confident
- Day 10: Completed my task even though I didn't want to
- Day 15: Used the reset technique when I got bad news
- Day 20: Feeling more in control of my day
- Day 25: Gratitude exercise is getting easier
- Day 30: This practice has become a habit

## What Happens After 30 Days?

After 30 days, you'll have built a foundation of tenacity and self-belief that can support you through difficult times. You'll have proven to yourself that you can take action even when you don't feel like it. You'll have started to reframe your past experiences through gratitude.

**But here's the thing: The work doesn't stop after 30 days.**

This practice is designed to become a lifelong habit. The goal isn't to eliminate depression entirely—it's to build the mental frameworks that help you manage it more effectively.

## The Bigger Picture

This simple daily practice is just the beginning. It's the foundation upon which all other mental health frameworks are built. Without tenacity, gratitude, and responsibility, the other strategies won't work as effectively.

**Remember:**
- You are in charge of your day
- You are in charge of your choices
- You are in charge of your story
- You are amazing

The goal isn't to never struggle with depression again. The goal is to build the mental strength and resilience to weather the storms and come out stronger on the other side.

**You've got this. And you're not alone in this journey.**

# Depression Trap Cards: What They Are and How to Build Yours

*It's 9 PM on a Sunday. I'm failing college. And I'm about to make the phone call I've been dreading all week.*

## The Phone Call That Changed Everything

I wasn't performing well in my classes, and I was feeling defeated as my peers excelled and I floundered. This wasn't a one-time occurrence, but I distinctly remember one especially emotional Sunday night around 9:00 PM. I was running out of distractions, and I finally decided to face my problem and call my parents.

They were funding a large portion of my college, and I was always scared to call them in these moments.

Walking outside after getting on the phone with my mom, I explained where I was at emotionally and how I was struggling to find traction in my classes. I spent 2 hours talking with my parents and walking around the block, discussing my next steps along with the coming consequences due to my slothfulness. I might need to withdraw from a class to get caught up in my others.

As the call concluded, I remember feeling grateful for her patience.

When I got back to my home, I laid down in the grass outside my apartment and stared up at the stars through watery eyes and pondered my emotions. My mom had set me straight and allowed my thoughts and feelings to confront the reality of my actions, and I now had a plan to fix my problems. However, the emotions were still fresh.

I went inside and proceeded to watch a portion of Disney's Treasure Planet that holds a special place in my heart from my childhood. As I watched what is arguably one of the best animated scenes of all time, accompanied by John Rzeznik's rendition of "I'm Still Here," I let the wave of emotions pour over me as I sang along. Tears now coming easier than they had earlier, I laid down on my sofa and I reminded myself that I belonged here in this life, with my family and friends.

This experience happened multiple times during college. I eventually began to call these decisions a Trap Card.

## What Is a Trap Card?

A Trap Card is a pre-planned strategy designed to pull you out of depressive states. I borrowed the concept from the Yu-Gi-Oh! card game, where trap cards activate when triggered by specific conditions.

**The key insight:** In that emotional space, my doppelgänger never wants to take the first step. In this story, the first step was reaching out to my mother. You'll notice another story of me on the phone with my mom shows up again, because it was the most effective Trap Card I had in college.

**The first step of every Trap Card you devise will always be the most painful one, and they almost always involve taking responsibility for things that are going on.**

When you are finally starting to come out of a depressive state, big or small, you feel great and you often wonder, "Why didn't I do that sooner?!" Even though moments ago, that was the last thing you would have ever wanted to do.

## The Anatomy of an Effective Trap Card

Let me break down my most frequently played Trap Card to show you how they work:

### Step 1: The Painful First Step
**A phone call with my mom to admit my mistakes and take responsibility for my actions.**

This is always the hardest part. Your Evil Doppelgänger will fight you on this. It will tell you that you're bothering people, that they don't want to hear from you, that you should figure it out on your own. But this is exactly why it works.

### Step 2: The Emotional Release
**Reconnected with my emotions by reflecting on a powerful emotional experience, in this case a film.**

After taking responsibility, you need a way to process all those pent-up emotions. This could be watching a movie, listening to music, going for a walk, or any activity that helps you feel and process your emotions.

### Step 3: The Recovery Action
**All those negative emotions from my slothfulness and positive emotions about my new plan are finally brought to the surface of my mind and heart all in a single moment, which allowed me to have an emotional release.**

The final step is taking some kind of action that moves you forward. This could be making a plan, doing something productive, or simply reminding yourself of your worth and belonging.

## Why Trap Cards Work

Trap Cards work because they're designed to activate when you're at your lowest, when your Evil Doppelgänger is running the show. Here's why they're so effective:

### 1. They're Pre-Planned
You design them when you're feeling good, not when you're already struggling. This means you're thinking clearly and can create strategies that will actually work.

### 2. They Address the Root Problem
The first step always involves taking responsibility, which is exactly what your doppelgänger doesn't want you to do. This is why it works.

### 3. They Provide Emotional Release
Depression often involves suppressed emotions. Trap Cards give you a safe way to process and release those emotions.

### 4. They Create Forward Momentum
By ending with a recovery action, Trap Cards help you move from a place of helplessness to a place of agency and control.

## Examples of Powerful Trap Cards

Here are some Trap Cards I would frequently use, along with others you might consider:

### The Phone Call Trap Card
- **Step 1:** Call a loved one and admit you're struggling
- **Step 2:** Walk outside and get some fresh air
- **Step 3:** Make a plan to address what's causing the depression

### The Roommate Trap Card
- **Step 1:** Explain your difficulties to someone you live with
- **Step 2:** Ask them to check in on you regularly
- **Step 3:** Create an accountability system

### The Service Trap Card
- **Step 1:** Do something productive and eccentric (like cleaning your room)
- **Step 2:** Focus on how it helps someone else
- **Step 3:** Build momentum with another small task

### The Pet Trap Card
- **Step 1:** Take care of your pet (feed, walk, play)
- **Step 2:** Focus on their needs and unconditional love
- **Step 3:** Use the momentum to take care of yourself

### The Creative Trap Card
- **Step 1:** Engage in a creative activity (draw, write, play music)
- **Step 2:** Express your emotions through the medium
- **Step 3:** Share your creation with someone you trust

## How to Build Your First Trap Card

Now it's time to create your own Trap Card. Here's the step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Identify the First Painful Step
This is usually taking responsibility for something. It might be:
- Admitting you're struggling to someone
- Asking for help
- Facing a problem you've been avoiding
- Making a difficult decision

**The key:** If your doppelgänger fights planning it, it'll work especially well.

### Step 2: Plan Your Emotional Release
This is something that helps you process your emotions. It might be:
- Watching a movie or TV show
- Listening to music
- Going for a walk
- Writing in a journal
- Calling a friend

### Step 3: Design Your Recovery Action
This is something that moves you forward. It might be:
- Making a plan
- Doing something productive
- Reaching out to someone
- Engaging in a hobby
- Practicing self-care

### Step 4: Test and Refine
Try your Trap Card and see how it works. You might need to adjust the steps or try different activities. The goal is to find what works for you.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Making Trap Cards Too Easy
If your Trap Card doesn't feel difficult or uncomfortable, it probably won't work. The first step should always be something you don't want to do.

### Not Planning Them Before Depression Hits
Trap Cards need to be designed when you're feeling good, not when you're already struggling. Your thinking is clearer, and you can create more effective strategies.

### Trying to Rationalize Out of Them
When you're in a depressive state, your doppelgänger will try to convince you not to use your Trap Card. This is actually a sign that it will work. Don't let the resistance stop you.

### Making Them Too Complicated
Keep your Trap Cards simple. Three steps are usually enough. You want something you can remember and execute even when you're not thinking clearly.

## Advanced Strategy: Multiple Trap Cards

As you get better at using Trap Cards, you can create different ones for different situations:

- **The Isolation Trap Card:** For when you're avoiding people
- **The Procrastination Trap Card:** For when you're avoiding responsibilities
- **The Overwhelm Trap Card:** For when everything feels too much
- **The Shame Trap Card:** For when you're feeling worthless

## The Science Behind Trap Cards

Trap Cards work because they address the three key components of depression recovery:

### 1. Agency
By taking responsibility (the first step), you reclaim your sense of agency and control.

### 2. Emotional Processing
By engaging in emotional release activities, you process suppressed emotions that are contributing to your depression.

### 3. Forward Momentum
By ending with a recovery action, you create positive momentum that can carry you out of the depressive state.

## When to Use Trap Cards

Trap Cards are most effective when:
- You recognize you're entering a depressive state
- You feel stuck or helpless
- You're avoiding important responsibilities
- You're isolating yourself from others
- You're engaging in destructive behaviors

## The Journey Forward

Building effective Trap Cards takes practice. You might not get it right the first time, and that's okay. The important thing is to keep trying and refining your approach.

**Remember:**
- The first step is always the hardest
- If you don't want to plan it, it'll work especially well
- You are in charge of your day
- You are in charge of your recovery

The goal isn't to eliminate depression entirely. The goal is to build the tools and strategies that help you recover faster and more effectively when it does strike.

**You've got this. And you're not alone in this journey.**

# How Long Does a Depressive Episode Last? (And How to Make It Shorter)

*Lying on the grass outside my apartment at midnight, crying while staring at the stars, I wondered: "How long is this going to last this time?"*

---

## The Question Everyone Asks

If you've ever experienced a depressive episode, you've probably asked yourself this question: "How long is this going to last?"

It's a natural question. When you're in the thick of depression, it can feel like it will never end. You might remember feeling better before, but in the moment, it's hard to imagine ever feeling good again.

The truth is, there's no one-size-fits-all answer. Depressive episodes can last anywhere from a few days to several months, depending on a variety of factors. But here's what I learned through my own struggles: **You can learn to make your episodes shorter and less debilitating.**

## The Reality of Depressive Episodes

Let me start with some context about what the research says:

- **Mild episodes** typically last 2-4 weeks
- **Moderate episodes** can last 4-8 weeks
- **Severe episodes** may last 8+ weeks
- **Cyclical depression** (like what I experienced) tends to have shorter episodes but more frequent recurrences

But here's the thing: **These are just averages. Your experience is unique to you.**

What matters more than the duration is understanding your own patterns and learning to manage them more effectively.

## Introducing Cycle Time

During my college years, I learned to think about depression management like a sport. In speed-based sports, the goal isn't to eliminate the challenge entirely—it's to get better at recognizing it, responding to it, and recovering from it.

I came to define this as my "Cycle Time"—the time it takes me to go from the start of a slump to my recovery.

**Think of it like a stopwatch: the time it takes you to go from the start of a depressive episode to your recovery is your Cycle Time.**

## The Three Factors That Determine Episode Length

Through my own experience and the frameworks I developed, I learned that three key factors determine how long a depressive episode lasts:

### 1. How Fast You Recognize Symptoms
The sooner you recognize that you're entering a depressive state, the sooner you can intervene. This is like recognizing the warning signs of a storm before it hits.

### 2. How Quickly You Intervene
Once you recognize the symptoms, how quickly do you take action? Do you have strategies ready to go, or do you wait and hope it will pass on its own?

### 3. How Well You Recover Emotionally
It's not just about getting out of the depressive state—it's about recovering emotionally so you're stronger for the next time.

## Mastering Your Cycles

The goal isn't to eliminate depression entirely (though that would be nice). The goal is to master your cycles—to recognize symptoms earlier, intervene faster, and recover more completely.

Here's how to do it:

### Phase 1: Identify Your Triggers
The first step is understanding what triggers your depressive episodes. This might be:
- Stressful life events
- Changes in routine
- Relationship problems
- Work or academic pressure
- Seasonal changes
- Lack of sleep or exercise

**Exercise:** Make a list of your known triggers. What situations or events tend to precede your depressive episodes?

### Phase 2: Learn Your Early Symptoms
Everyone's early warning signs are different. Yours might be:
- Changes in sleep patterns
- Loss of interest in activities
- Increased irritability
- Difficulty concentrating
- Changes in appetite
- Social withdrawal
- Negative self-talk

**Exercise:** Track your symptoms for a few weeks. What do you notice in the days before a full depressive episode?

### Phase 3: Play Your Trap Cards Faster
Once you recognize the early symptoms, it's time to activate your pre-planned strategies (what I call "Trap Cards"). The key is to act quickly, before the depression takes full hold.

**The faster you intervene, the shorter your episode will be.**

### Phase 4: Improve Your Emotional Recovery
Recovery isn't just about feeling better—it's about building resilience for the next time. This means:
- Processing your emotions fully
- Learning from the experience
- Strengthening your support systems
- Refining your strategies

## The Cycle Time Improvement Process

Here's how to systematically improve your cycle time:

### Week 1: Baseline Assessment
- Track your current cycle time
- Identify your triggers and early symptoms
- Note what strategies you currently use

### Week 2: Early Recognition
- Practice recognizing your early symptoms
- Set up systems to catch them sooner
- Create reminders to check in with yourself

### Week 3: Faster Intervention
- Pre-plan your Trap Cards
- Practice activating them quickly
- Remove barriers to taking action

### Week 4: Better Recovery
- Focus on emotional processing
- Build stronger support systems
- Celebrate your progress

## Real Strategies for Shorter Episodes

Based on my own experience, here are the most effective strategies for shortening depressive episodes:

### 1. The Sunday Night Check-In
Every Sunday evening, I would call my parents and give them an honest update about how I was doing. This created accountability and gave me a safe space to process my emotions.

**How to implement:**
- Choose a consistent time each week
- Be honest about your struggles
- Ask for their perspective and advice
- Use it as a planning session for the week ahead

### 2. The Daily "Who Is in Charge?" Practice
Every morning, I would ask myself: "Who is in charge of my day?" and answer: "I AM!" This simple practice reminded me of my agency, even when I didn't feel like I had any.

**How to implement:**
- Ask the question every morning
- Answer out loud, even if you don't believe it
- Choose one small productive task to complete
- Build momentum throughout the day

### 3. The Trap Card System
Pre-planned strategies that activate when you're in a depressive state. The key is to design them when you're feeling good, not when you're already struggling.

**How to implement:**
- Identify the first painful step (usually taking responsibility)
- Plan an emotional release activity
- Design a recovery action
- Practice activating them quickly

### 4. The Environment Audit
Your environment has a huge impact on your mental health. Regular audits can help you identify and address factors that contribute to longer episodes.

**How to implement:**
- Evaluate your living situation
- Assess your social connections
- Review your daily responsibilities
- Check your access to healthy activities

## What If Episodes Are Getting Longer?

If you notice that your depressive episodes are getting longer or more frequent, it might be time to take more serious action:

### Immediate Steps:
- Talk to someone you trust about what you're experiencing
- Consider reducing stress in your life
- Focus on basic self-care (sleep, nutrition, exercise)
- Reach out for professional help

### Long-term Strategies:
- Build stronger support systems
- Develop more effective coping strategies
- Address underlying issues
- Consider therapy or medication

## The Goal Isn't Elimination

Here's something important to understand: **The goal isn't to eliminate depression entirely.** For many people, depression is cyclical, and that's okay.

The goal is to master your cycles—to recognize symptoms earlier, intervene faster, and recover more completely. It's about getting better at the game, not avoiding playing it entirely.

## Tracking Your Progress

To improve your cycle time, you need to track your progress. Here's a simple system:

### Daily Tracking:
- Mood rating (1-10)
- Energy level (1-10)
- Sleep quality
- Stress level
- Any triggers or symptoms

### Weekly Review:
- How long did your last episode last?
- What triggered it?
- How quickly did you recognize it?
- What strategies did you use?
- How can you improve next time?

### Monthly Assessment:
- What's your average cycle time?
- What patterns do you notice?
- What strategies are working best?
- What needs to be adjusted?

## The Journey Forward

Improving your cycle time takes practice and patience. You won't get it right every time, and that's okay. The important thing is to keep learning and adapting.

**Remember:**
- You are in charge of your day
- You can learn to manage your cycles
- Progress, not perfection, is the goal
- You're not alone in this journey

The goal isn't to never struggle with depression again. The goal is to build the skills and strategies that help you recover faster and more effectively when it does strike.

**You've got this. And you're not alone in this fight.**

# The False Belief Behind Your Depression (And How to Find It)

*I thought I hated college. My father asked one question that changed everything.*

---

## The Question That Revealed Everything

During my time in college, I consistently felt like I didn't deserve to be there, that someone else deserved the experience more than me. I felt lost and confused, and I thought the problem was college itself.

Speaking to my father about this feeling over the phone, he inquired whether or not I felt like I was doing my best in college, to which I replied "No." He followed with another question: "Would someone else do better than you?" Admittedly, I felt that they would. "Yes," I responded.

Finally, he said, "What you are feeling is a lack of confidence and self-worth, it has nothing to do with college and everything to do with how you perceive yourself and your efforts."

The words hurt because they were true. I had been so distracted by college that I hadn't stopped to ponder whether my feelings were isolated to this event or situation, or if they were widespread.

This experience taught me that **the source of your pain is often obscured by a surface-level circumstance.**

## Surface Pain vs. Source Pain

Here's what I want you to understand: **What you think is causing your depression might not be the real problem at all.**

Your emotions are complex. What you're feeling on the surface may not be related to the underlying problem. It's like an onion—you have to peel back the layers to find what's really going on.

**The surface problem:** I hate college. I don't belong here. I'm not smart enough for this.

**The real problem:** I believe I am less capable than other people and therefore do not deserve the experiences I am having.

## What Is a False Belief?

A false belief is a deep-seated, incorrect belief that's causing surface-level pain. It's usually something you've internalized over time, often without realizing it.

**Common false beliefs in depression:**
- "I am not worthy of love"
- "I am fundamentally broken"
- "I don't deserve good things"
- "I am not as capable as other people"
- "People are better off without me"
- "I will always be this way"
- "I am a burden to others"
- "I am not enough"

These beliefs are usually formed early in life, often as a result of difficult experiences or messages you received from others. They become so deeply ingrained that you don't even realize they're there—they just feel like the truth.

## Why Surface Solutions Don't Work

This is why so many people struggle with depression despite trying various treatments and strategies. **You can't fix what you don't understand.**

If you think the problem is college, you might try changing schools or dropping out. But if the real problem is a false belief about your capabilities, you'll just carry that belief with you wherever you go.

If you think the problem is your job, you might try changing careers. But if the real problem is a false belief about your worth, you'll just find the same struggles in a new environment.

**The key insight:** You have to address the false belief, not just the surface circumstances.

## The Process of Identification

Finding your false beliefs isn't easy, but it's crucial for lasting recovery. Here's the process I learned:

### Step 1: Find Someone to Talk Openly With
You need someone who will challenge your opinions and force you to further define and defend them. This might be a therapist, a trusted friend, a family member, or a life coach.

**The right person will:**
- Ask probing questions
- Challenge your assumptions
- Help you dig deeper
- Not let you off the hook with surface answers

### Step 2: Vocally Articulate Your Feelings
By talking through why you feel a certain way and learning how to articulate those feelings with words, you will begin to accurately identify the source of your pain.

**Start with:** "I feel [emotion] about [situation] because [reason]."

**Then ask:** "Is this really about [situation], or is it about something deeper?"

### Step 3: Write It Down
Once you identify a false belief, write it down. Having those emotions clearly defined in words is worth its weight in gold when it comes to comprehending how to overcome the difficulties you're facing in life.

**Example:** "I believe that I am less capable than other people and therefore do not deserve the experiences I am having."

### Step 4: Be Honest
You may get the source wrong a hundred times. But as you continue to be vulnerable and peel back your emotions, layer by layer, while seeking with sincerity, you will find the false belief that is causing flawed perceptions of yourself or the world around you.

## The College Conversation: A Real Example

Let me walk you through the conversation that changed everything for me:

**Me:** "I hate college. I don't belong here. I'm not smart enough for this."

**My Dad:** "Do you feel like you're doing your best in college?"

**Me:** "No."

**My Dad:** "Would someone else do better than you?"

**Me:** "Yes."

**My Dad:** "What you are feeling is a lack of confidence and self-worth, it has nothing to do with college and everything to do with how you perceive yourself and your efforts."

**The false belief I discovered:** "I believe that I am less capable than other people and therefore do not deserve the experiences I am having."

## Common False Beliefs in Depression

Based on my experience and the conversations I've had with others, here are some of the most common false beliefs that contribute to depression:

### "I Am Not Worthy of Love"
This belief often stems from early experiences of rejection or abandonment. It can manifest as pushing people away, avoiding relationships, or staying in unhealthy relationships.

### "I Am Fundamentally Broken"
This belief usually comes from internalizing negative messages about yourself. It can lead to feelings of hopelessness and the belief that you can't be fixed.

### "I Don't Deserve Good Things"
This belief often develops when you've experienced hardship or trauma. It can prevent you from pursuing opportunities or accepting help when it's offered.

### "I Am Not as Capable as Other People"
This belief can develop from comparing yourself to others or receiving critical messages about your abilities. It can lead to self-sabotage and avoidance of challenges.

### "People Are Better Off Without Me"
This belief often develops from feeling like a burden to others. It can lead to isolation and the belief that your presence makes things worse.

## What to Do Once You Find It

Identifying your false belief is just the beginning. Here's what comes next:

### 1. Acknowledge It
The first step is simply acknowledging that this belief exists and that it's not true. This can be incredibly difficult because false beliefs often feel like fundamental truths.

### 2. Challenge It
Start questioning the belief. Is it really true? What evidence do you have for it? What evidence do you have against it?

### 3. Reframe It
Work on developing a more accurate and helpful belief. This might be:
- "I am worthy of love and connection"
- "I am capable of growth and change"
- "I deserve good things in my life"
- "I have unique strengths and abilities"
- "My presence adds value to others' lives"

### 4. Build Evidence
Start collecting evidence that supports your new belief. This might be:
- Compliments you receive
- Accomplishments you achieve
- Positive relationships you build
- Challenges you overcome

### 5. Practice Self-Compassion
Be patient with yourself as you work to change these deeply ingrained beliefs. It takes time and practice.

## The Power of a Coach or Mentor

I can't overstate the importance of having someone who can help you think through these problems. The right person will know how to help you delve deeper into your emotions and discover their source.

**What to look for in a coach or mentor:**
- Someone who asks good questions
- Someone who challenges your assumptions
- Someone who doesn't let you off the hook
- Someone who believes in your potential
- Someone who has experience with mental health

## The Journey Forward

Finding and addressing your false beliefs is a lifelong journey. You might discover new ones as you grow and change. The important thing is to keep seeking, keep questioning, and keep growing.

**Remember:**
- You are not your false beliefs
- You are capable of change
- You deserve love and connection
- You are worthy of good things
- You are enough

The goal isn't to never have false beliefs again. The goal is to recognize them, challenge them, and choose more helpful beliefs instead.

## A Final Thought

The conversation with my father didn't magically fix my depression. It didn't make college suddenly easy or enjoyable. But it did something more important: **it gave me clarity about what I was really dealing with.**

Once I understood that the problem wasn't college but my false belief about my capabilities, I could start working on the real issue. I could start building evidence that I was capable. I could start challenging the belief that I didn't deserve to be there.

**The clarity you gain by understanding the source of your pain is fundamentally connected to your capacity to comprehend and therefore resolve that pain.**

# Lightbulbs vs. Sunrises: Why Depression Recovery Takes Time (And That's Okay)

*I wanted a miracle cure. A pill, a book, a revelation that would fix everything overnight. What I got was a sunrise.*

---

## The Problem With Quick Fix Culture

If you're reading this, you've probably been there. You've probably searched for the magic solution that would make your depression disappear forever. You've probably tried the latest self-help trend, the newest supplement, or the most promising therapy technique, hoping that this time, it would be different.

I know I did. I wanted a miracle cure. A pill, a book, a revelation that would fix everything overnight. I wanted to wake up one day and be completely healed, never to struggle with depression again.

But here's the thing: **That's not how healing works.**

## The Two Types of Solutions

Through my own journey with depression, I learned to distinguish between two types of solutions:

### Lightbulbs: Quick Solutions
There will be times when a solution or support arrives quickly in your life, like turning on a lightbulb in a dark room. These are:
- Sudden epiphanies or breakthroughs
- Unexpected blessings or opportunities
- People who suddenly appear to help
- Medications that work immediately
- Therapy sessions that click right away

**Lightbulbs are real, and they're valuable.** But here's the problem: **You can't rely on them.**

### Sunrises: Gradual Progress
Most of the time, I found that my "solutions" developed slowly as I built up good habits and remained honest with myself. In the same way that your Evil Doppelgänger attempts to poison you subtly and slowly, your desires and tenacity are like a slow sunrise that breaks down their power and hold over you.

**Sunrises are:**
- Hard effort and consistent action
- Proactivity and good habits
- Building emotional bedrock over time
- The combination of all frameworks working together
- Gradual progress through daily practice

## Why This Is Actually Good News

At first, the idea that healing takes time can feel discouraging. But here's why it's actually good news:

### 1. You Don't Need a Breakthrough
You don't need to wait for a miracle or a perfect moment. You can start making progress right now, today, with small consistent actions.

### 2. Small Actions Compound
Every small step you take builds on the previous one. Making your bed today might not seem like much, but combined with all the other small actions, it creates momentum that can carry you through difficult times.

### 3. You're in Control
Unlike lightbulbs, which you can't control, sunrises are entirely within your power. You can choose to take action, build habits, and make progress every single day.

### 4. Progress Is Sustainable
Quick fixes often don't last. But the progress you make through consistent effort and good habits is much more likely to stick around long-term.

## The Foundation Trinity in Action

The three core principles I learned—tenacity, gratitude, and responsibility—are all about building sunrises, not waiting for lightbulbs:

### Tenacity is the Mindset
Every day, you choose to believe that you're in charge of your day. You choose to take action, even when you don't feel like it. This isn't a one-time decision—it's a daily practice.

### Gratitude is the Choice
You choose to reframe your past experiences through gratitude, seeing challenges as opportunities for growth. This isn't a one-time reframe—it's an ongoing practice of shifting your perspective.

### Responsibility is the Reward
As you build tenacity and gratitude, you start to see responsibility not as a burden, but as an opportunity to create the future you want. This isn't a one-time realization—it's a gradual shift in how you view your life.

## The Combination Effect

Here's what I discovered: **The real magic happens when all the frameworks work together.**

The combination of my Foundation, Trap Cards, Mastering my Cycles, Environment, and Identifying the Source(s) became the basis of my continual progression. Without an ongoing combination of each of those, I would stumble more often than I care to admit.

**It's not about doing one thing perfectly—it's about doing many things consistently.**

## The Long-Term Solution

As time went on, I recognized that I had a growing craving for companionship. I saw how my life was better with my close friends and how it was harder when they would move away or get married. It occurred to me that my relationships with them empowered me to maintain a life that I love.

It became obvious: **to solve the environment problem in the long term, I would have to find a companion to build a foundation of support and love with.**

When I found my spouse, she broke down my anxieties and cured the cracks in my emotional bedrock. I had found someone that I could create a life with and build a foundation more solid than I was personally capable of.

**This is what sunrise healing looks like:** Building relationships, creating support systems, and developing the emotional bedrock that sustains you through life's challenges.

## The Emotional Bedrock

The emotional bedrock is the inner strength and stability that sustains you through life's challenges and changes. It's built through:

- Consistent application of all frameworks
- Strong relationships and support systems
- Good habits and daily practices
- Self-awareness and emotional intelligence
- A sense of purpose and meaning

**This takes time to build, but once it's there, it's incredibly powerful.**

## The Journey of a Lifetime

Here's what I want you to understand: **Managing depression is a lifelong journey.**

As the David in your story, slaying your Goliaths may not be something that happens in an instant. It will be a life-long effort where tenacity and proactive effort will be key.

**The goal isn't to eliminate depression entirely—it's to master it.**

## What This Means for You

If you're struggling with depression and feeling frustrated that it's not going away quickly, here's what I want you to know:

### 1. You're Not Failing
The fact that you're still struggling doesn't mean you're doing something wrong. It means you're dealing with a complex challenge that requires time and patience.

### 2. Small Progress Counts
Every small step you take is progress. Every day you choose to take action is a victory. Every moment you choose to believe in yourself is a step forward.

### 3. You're Building Something
Even when it doesn't feel like it, you're building emotional bedrock. You're developing resilience. You're becoming stronger and more capable.

### 4. You're Not Alone
This journey is difficult, but you don't have to do it alone. There are people who want to help you, support you, and walk alongside you.

## The Power of Patience

One of the most important lessons I learned is the power of patience. Not patience as in waiting passively, but patience as in trusting the process and continuing to take action even when you don't see immediate results.

**The sunrise always comes, but it takes time.**

## A Final Thought

I want to leave you with this: **The journey of healing from depression is not a sprint—it's a marathon.**

There will be days when you feel like you're making no progress. There will be days when you want to give up. There will be days when the sunrise feels impossibly far away.

But here's the truth: **Every step you take matters. Every choice you make counts. Every moment you choose to believe in yourself is a victory.**

The goal isn't to never struggle with depression again. The goal is to build the strength, resilience, and support systems that help you weather the storms and come out stronger on the other side.

**You've got this. And you're not alone in this journey.**

# Why Gratitude Isn't Toxic Positivity (And How It Actually Helps Depression)

*When someone told me to "just be grateful" during my worst depressive episode, I wanted to scream.*

## The Gratitude Problem

If you've ever struggled with depression, you've probably heard this advice: "Just be grateful for what you have."

And if you're like me, your first reaction was probably something like: "Are you kidding me? I can barely get out of bed, and you want me to be grateful?"

I get it. When you're in the depths of depression, being told to "just be grateful" can feel like a slap in the face. It can feel like someone is minimizing your pain, telling you to ignore your struggles, or suggesting that your depression is your fault.

**But here's the thing: That's not what gratitude actually is.**

## What Gratitude ISN'T

Let me start by clarifying what gratitude is not, because this distinction is crucial:

### 1. Denying Pain
Gratitude is not about pretending that your pain doesn't exist or that everything is fine when it's not. It's not about putting on a happy face when you're struggling inside.

### 2. Pretending Everything Is Fine
Gratitude is not about ignoring real problems or pretending that difficult situations are actually good. It's not about toxic positivity or forced cheerfulness.

### 3. Ignoring Real Problems
Gratitude is not about avoiding difficult conversations or pretending that systemic issues don't exist. It's not about being grateful for things that are actually harmful.

### 4. Minimizing Struggles
Gratitude is not about telling someone to "just be grateful" when they're dealing with serious mental health challenges. It's not about making people feel guilty for their struggles.

## What Gratitude Actually IS

Now let me explain what gratitude actually is, and why it can be so powerful for managing depression:

### 1. Extracting Growth from Pain
Gratitude is about finding meaning and growth in difficult experiences AFTER acknowledging that they were painful. It's not about denying the pain—it's about finding what you learned from it.

### 2. Reframing Perception
Gratitude is about choosing to see your experiences through a different lens. It's about recognizing that your perception of events has a huge impact on how they affect you.

### 3. A Choice, Not a Feeling
Gratitude is not about feeling grateful all the time. It's about choosing to look for the good, even when you don't feel like it. It's a practice, not a mood.

### 4. Building Evidence
Gratitude is about collecting evidence that good things can happen, that you can grow from challenges, and that the future holds possibilities.

## The Perception Shift

Here's one of the most powerful insights I learned about gratitude:

**The popular phrase "You are the product of your experiences" completely omits your biggest superpower and tool: your mind.**

By including your mind as a variable, the statement changes to: **"You are the product of the PERCEPTION of your experiences."**

This distinct shift in perspective is especially powerful when you point your perceptions toward gratitude. **Gratitude changes responsibility into its true and final form: a reward.**

## How Gratitude Changes Depression

Here's how gratitude actually helps with depression:

### 1. It Reframes Your Past
When you can find gratitude in your past experiences, even the painful ones, you start to see them as sources of strength rather than sources of pain. This changes how you view yourself and your capabilities.

### 2. It Transforms Responsibility
Without gratitude, responsibility feels like a burden. With gratitude, responsibility becomes an opportunity to create the future you want. This shift is incredibly powerful for motivation and hope.

### 3. It Builds Evidence
Every time you find something to be grateful for, you're building evidence that good things can happen in your life. This evidence becomes a foundation for hope and optimism.

### 4. It Creates Forward Momentum
When you can see the good in your past, you start to believe that good things are possible in your future. This creates motivation and energy to take action.

## The Practical Gratitude Exercise

Here's the gratitude exercise I learned, and it's much more nuanced than "just be grateful":

### Step 1: Identify a Painful Experience
Choose a difficult experience from your past. It doesn't have to be the worst thing that ever happened to you, but it should be something that was genuinely painful.

### Step 2: Assess What You Learned
What did you learn from this experience? What skills did you develop? What insights did you gain?

### Step 3: Extract Strengths
What strengths have come from this experience? How did it make you more resilient, empathetic, or capable?

### Step 4: Find the Silver Lining
How did this experience help you empathize with or help others going through similar challenges? How did it make you a better person?

### Step 5: Redefine the Experience
By extracting these perceptions, you are choosing to redefine and find gratitude in an experience—not by denying the pain, but by recognizing the growth that came from it.

## The Three-Part Foundation

Gratitude works best when it's part of a larger framework. Here's how it fits into the three-part foundation I learned:

### 1. Tenacity is the Mindset
You choose to believe that you're in charge of your day and your life, even when you don't feel like it.

### 2. Gratitude is the Choice
You choose to reframe your experiences through gratitude, seeing challenges as opportunities for growth.

### 3. Responsibility is the Reward
As you build tenacity and gratitude, responsibility transforms from a burden into an opportunity to create the future you want.

## When Gratitude Is Genuinely Hard

I want to acknowledge that some experiences are genuinely difficult to reframe. Some traumas, losses, or hardships don't have obvious silver linings, and that's okay.

**The key is to start where you can.** You don't have to find gratitude in your worst experiences right away. Start with smaller challenges, and work your way up. The practice itself is what matters, not the magnitude of the experience.

## The Real Example: Reframing College Depression

Let me share how I applied this to my own experience with college depression:

**The painful experience:** I struggled with depression throughout college, feeling like I didn't belong and wasn't capable of succeeding.

**What I learned:** I learned how to manage my emotions, build support systems, and develop coping strategies.

**Strengths that came from it:** I became more empathetic to others struggling with mental health, more resilient in the face of challenges, and more aware of my own needs and limitations.

**How it helped others:** I was able to support friends who were struggling with similar issues, and eventually write a book to help others going through the same thing.

**The reframe:** College became a masterclass in learning how to manage depression and build emotional resilience, rather than just a difficult experience I had to endure.

## The Power of Perspective

Here's the thing about gratitude: **It doesn't change what happened to you, but it changes how you view what happened to you.**

This shift in perspective is incredibly powerful because it affects everything else in your life. When you can see your past as a source of strength rather than a source of pain, you start to approach your future with more hope and optimism.

## A Final Thought

I want to be clear: **Gratitude is not a cure for depression.** It's not a replacement for therapy, medication, or other treatments. It's one tool among many that can help you manage your mental health more effectively.

But when used correctly, gratitude can be incredibly powerful. It can help you reframe your experiences, build hope for the future, and transform responsibility from a burden into an opportunity.

**The goal isn't to feel grateful all the time. The goal is to practice gratitude consistently, even when you don't feel like it.**
